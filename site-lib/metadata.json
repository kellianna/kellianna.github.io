This won't wow you or keep you up at night or even be something you'll tell a friend about later. It's just a beginning. It's just a scene that will lead nowhere except to a place in your heart where you store your longing. A place that writes vignettes of another reality. That's all this is. A vignette of another reality that you write at night right before you fall asleep, the kind you won't even remember in the morning.This is what I tell myself when I sit down to write, so the pressure isn't too much. So that I can just pour out a story and not worry if anyone will care. It's just a nothing thing. An everyday thing. Which is how a lot of really meaningful things start. At least that's what I tell myself to convince myself it's not all a waste of time.But it's really all a waste of time, right? You live, you die, and the time in between will never really matter. Some would say it might matter a little more to those who actually change the times they're living in. Some would say that good people like Martin Luther King Jr and bad people like Hitler had changed the times they were living in and so maybe their time wasn't wasted. I say maybe Hitler needed a good hobby to distract him. And that MLK would be disappointed by how little has actually changed.Now I'm not just wasting time, but words since I haven't even begun to tell you a story. A story you could call mine, but I can't prove that any of it really happened this way, or that it really happened at all. Sometimes those other realities blur and I can't tell one from another.In this reality, I'm a writer. I already told you that. A writer with zero faith in her writing, which is probably why no one has ever read it. Actually, the members of my writing group have read me. And a few people I know online who write. But to the world at large I am insignificant, as I'm guessing you are as well. We are destined to die in obscurity. Which can either be freeing or depressing depending on your outlook. I choose to see it as freeing, as I have seen first hand the double edged sword of fame. My father wrote a bestseller and became something of a household name in the 1980s when people still read hardcovers and authors would appear on talk shows. It helped that he looked like a rock star and had never married my mother. The women swooned for his long hair and novels of life on tour as a roadie. Something he liked to tell people he had actually done.That's what I mean about the blurring of realities. At one time I thought my father was lying to sell more books, until I realized some part of him had come to believe that he had actually carried tour gear for Kiss in the 70s. And that he had slept with Paul Stanley's discarded groupies. If you ever read one of his novels, remember they're fiction. The only tour my father ever took was a book tour and the only thing he ever carried was the weight of a dream so heavy he had to set it down someplace. It fit perfectly on 8x11 typewriter paper, and even better in between two covers.I won't lie. I inherited his penchant for fabrication. His belief in the realities that only existed in his mind. I came to believe I was something special by association. That I had lived those book tours and waited behind the curtains at talk shows for my father to introduce the world to his daughter.In reality I was at home with my mother, reading about girls who fit in and had boyfriends named Kevin who saved them from some supernatural bad guy.Listening to my mother on the phone with another woman in another state who had just learned that my father had a daughter. Did my mother know that my father also had a son about a year older than me? Her face said she didn't, but she used her polite stranger voice and set up a meeting with the woman and my half brother. My life would never be the same.My brother Dave was everything I wasn't. Confident, loud, bratty, and hilarious. He couldn't care less that our dad only visited him twice a year, while I constantly sent my dad the short stories I wrote in hopes he would see that I was just like him. Our moms hit it off instantly and decided that Dave and I should be raised together so we would feel more like we had a family, so they bought a duplex in Illinois, halfway between their hometowns, and raised us together. What we were lacking in a father, we more than made up for in mothers.I bet you're wondering what the hell any of this has to do with anything and why the hell you should care. As we already established, I'm insignificant. I'm the child of a minor celebrity who no one even remembers as the author of a few novels that can quite often be found stuffed behind the Harlequin romances in used bookstores. I haven't given you a reason to care about this backstory. You don't even know my name or why you should waste your time turning the next page. But, let me ask you something. Isn't that the way you go into every novel? Not really knowing why you should care? And yes, I probably should have found a clever way to work this backstory into the main action - show, don't tell and all of that good advice, but I feel like you need to know where I've been to really care about where I am. Your time is precious so wouldn't you rather I just spend a few paragraphs getting you caught up? Don't you sometimes secretly wish an author would just get on with it and tell you what you need to know? I promise, neither one of us will believe where this ends up.Dave and I were inseparable once we became aware that the other existed. Dave was my playmate, my co-conspirator, my confidante, and eventually my protector. I was quiet, naive, and still seeking my father's love and Dave was constantly pulling me back from situations where I was ready to give myself too soon to feel special. In high school he relished the role of misfit while I dreamt of being popular like the girls in my teen romances. That is, until Dave discovered punk rock and dragged me along with him into the mosh pit. Literally and figuratively. Here were misfits who fit. Here were girls who would rather die than be one of the popular kids. Here was a bass line and a three chord progression that slid into my cochlea and threw itself around the inside of my ear. Here was something that made me feel alive. And made me want to tell my dad to fuck off, since telling your parents to fuck off was now cool. Our poor mothers.Where I was content to listen and let the anger wash over me, Dave wanted to create the rage. He wanted to be the one slamming his way into the safety pinned ears of the punks. And he wanted me to join him. He bought a drum set, he befriended a couple of punks at school who could play the requisite three chords, and we were a band. Although I wasn't quite sure what my role in the whole thing was. I had written a few songs because they weren't that different from the angsty poetry all teenagers write between the ages of 13 and 17. I liked the way the music wrapped around my words and animated them. Made them stand up in 3D and declare their existence. Dave decided I should sing because, really, it was better to not be able to sing in a punk band anyway. We called ourselves Yeah Nadia, because why not?That's how I ended up losing my virginity in a back room at The Fireside Bowl with a guy who also couldn't sing and fronted a band called Automat Sandwich. The band sucked, but he was a really nice guy who asked multiple times during our what-the-hell-am-I-doing sex if I was ok. I always thought that was sweet and while the relationship went nowhere, we stayed friends when he started another band and actually had some minor fame.If I ever start another band, which I won't, I might call it \"Minor Fame Adjacent,\" since that's how my life has gone. Brushes with minor celebrities while living in obscurity. Dave gave up on the band and went to college for business. I actually held on to the lead singer role until grunge came along and killed punk, and I graduated from high school and decided I needed a real job. That's how they get you to give up, how they convince you to hang up your torn fishnets and do something respectable. They ask you how you'll pay your bills and what kind of life you think you'll have sweating your makeup off every night for an audience of twenty. So I followed Dave to college and majored in writing. Because, yeah, that was a more reliable path (I obviously had learned nothing from my absentee father.)","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"02-seedlings/making-it-up-as-i-go/01-chapter-one.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756130778969,"modifiedTime":1756130790725,"sourceSize":8498,"sourcePath":"02 Seedlings/Making It Up As I Go/01 Chapter One.md","exportPath":"02-seedlings/making-it-up-as-i-go/01-chapter-one.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":23,"backlinks":["02-seedlings/making-it-up-as-i-go/00-introduction.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02-seedlings/making-it-up-as-i-go/02-chapter-two.html":{"title":"02 Chapter Two","icon":"","description":"So far everything I've told you is reality. Not the shifting reality of falling asleep or staring out the window at nothing, but the real story. I can even tell you that the lead singer who put his hands between my legs and asked if it was ok was named Jay. And he had amazing hair and applied his eyeliner with more care than I did my own. I can tell you that college sucked for me because I reverted to the quiet writer who lingered in the library drinking coffee at midnight and reading Virginia Woolf because I thought that's what I should be doing. I had followed Dave's lead from one thing to another and had never really chosen an identity of my own. Was I writing to gain Daddy's love? Or to feel that feeling of the way words wound around my throat and erupted in raw emotion like they had on stage? I didn't know because I never asked. I was the shadow of my older brother, I was a ghost, a personality thin enough to see through even if my body had worn a size XL school girl skirt with my fishnets.Dave graduated and started working for a record company as an unpaid intern, which meant he was also working as a cashier at a grocery store to pay the bills. School and life pulled us apart and for the first time I was rudderless, unmoored without my big brother to guide and protect me. I graduated a year later and got a job offer to write for a pop culture website. The internet was still relatively new and the opportunity was too good to pass up, even if the job was in Milwaukee. Further away from everything that grounded me, I set up a home in a tiny apartment just outside of the city and took the bus to an even tinier office everyday. The other women working at the website were beauty experts or die hard fans of the popular bands that they played on the \"adult\" listening stations. Not one of them had ever heard of Henry Rollins or The Misfits. Not one of them had ever been a misfit. Not one of them had ever pulled their stockings down to let a boy who's leather jacket smelled like beer and sweat inside them in a tiny backroom while a cover of \"Ball and Chain\" blasted outside the door. And not one of them would have believed that I had done that very thing. The fat girl who handled the section of the website that focused on best selling books. Mostly self help and romances - you can see the demographic.You've probably noticed that I brought up this tryst with Jay three times already in just the first chapter and a half. That's mostly because it was all the sex I had for many years after. It wasn't just that one time either. There was an actual hotel room in Madison where we slept wrapped around each other after. Where I woke up to green eyes staring into mine and his hand on my hip. Soon to be on my knees taking him into my mouth while he moaned my name and I believed in love songs all over again. But since then, I had just been the quiet college literature student who flew under the radar and didn't invite either scorn or interest from anyone. Three things happened in perfect synchronicity around this time. I started writing a novel, I got a job at a proper magazine (as a book reviewer, I seemed to have accidentally fallen into a niche career), and my dad reached out to both Dave and me. He was washed up. His most recent wife had left him and he was feeling the years. Dave flat out refused to see him and encouraged me to return the letters unopened. For the first time in our lives, Dave and I were on opposite ends of a situation. My instinct was to listen to my big brother who had always protected me, but I also had a big empty hole where my dad would fit perfectly. As serendipity would have it, my dad was in Seattle and that's where the magazine was headquartered. Plus, my novel needed a setting, why not the Pacific Northwest?This is where you think the story starts. This is where you're thinking that the backstory is finally over and we can get on with whatever the fuck this book is supposed to be about. I wish it were that simple. I wish I could tell you that yes, this is where the story really gets going. Where I got in touch with my dad, love my job and Seattle and I lived happily ever after. Well, that wouldn't make much of a novel, now would it?No. Things kind of went of the rails in a place known for rain and the birth of Nirvana. I had resisted grunge for a long time after it killed off my beloved punk, but I had come around by the time I found myself in Seattle. By now Kurt was dead and there was something post grunge about the whole scene, but that didn't stop me from immersing myself in the music scene. Maybe throwing on a hippie dress and leaving it on the floor of some drummer's apartment overnight. I found that drummers had the best rhythm when it came to tongues on certain body parts. it was the drummers that would have me rocking my hips and begging for more. But, none of it went anywhere. And neither did the novel.I was trying to write in between club nights, book reviews, and raindrops and there wasn't enough coffee in Seattle to power that. The story was about a popular girl who found out her group of friends were all aliens underneath perfect faces and hair. My plan for the ending was that the girl was an alien too, but it was just as awful as it sounds. I would write and rewrite, but there was no saving what was a horrible idea from the beginning. I was writing amazing book reviews for the magazine, maybe I should have made note of what worked in the novels I loved most.But, you're waiting to hear about my reunion with my dad. You don't care about awful novels and drummers with shoulder tattoos and amazing tongues. The story doesn't really start there either, but at least it went better than my novel.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"02-seedlings/making-it-up-as-i-go/02-chapter-two.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756130932252,"modifiedTime":1756130942045,"sourceSize":5743,"sourcePath":"02 Seedlings/Making It Up As I Go/02 Chapter Two.md","exportPath":"02-seedlings/making-it-up-as-i-go/02-chapter-two.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":24,"backlinks":["02-seedlings/making-it-up-as-i-go/00-introduction.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02-seedlings/making-it-up-as-i-go/03-chapter-three.html":{"title":"03 Chapter Three","icon":"","description":"The first time I saw my dad after 20 years, I couldn't help but think that he looked small and old and not like someone who had ever been on talk shows or who had multiple women in multiple towns. There was something of aging rock star about him, but in a sad, one hit wonder kind of way. The ones who never change their hairstyles and cling to the hits their fans came to hear. They're frozen in time. That was my dad and it broke my heart.He came to my apartment with a teddy bear under one arm and a bottle of wine under the other. An unpublished manuscript and a check for $5000 tucked under the first page. After coming in and setting everything down, he gave me the first hug I had gotten from my dad since I could only reach around his waist and beg him not to leave. To take me with him wherever he was going. He told me the teddy bear was for that little girl, the wine was for the woman I had become without him, the check was for all the payments he had missed, and not to worry about the manuscript for now. It was just something he thought I might like to read. If I had the time.We ate pasta, drank wine, and he asked about Dave and my mom. He told me about the drug problem he had developed in the 80s and how he'd been sober for the last year. He told me all of his money had gone to drugs and ex-wives. He told me that he had wanted to connect with me over the years, but he wanted to wait until he had another hit novel, a caring wife, and no cocaine up his nose. He decided to go for 1/3 because he was doing that thing where addicts try to right their wrongs. He hoped that didn't sound like that's the only reason he wanted to see me, but he did hope he could gain my forgiveness and maybe I could read his manuscript. See if it was something I could write up for the magazine. Get the word of mouth going. I was too desperate for him to love me to realize there wasn't much in this for me.I wasn't sure what I would have done with a situation where there was something in it for me. So I read his manuscript, told him it was great, kept plugging away at my terrible novel, fought traffic into the city, and drank too much with smelly bands in hole in the wall nightclubs. And never thought that it was the stuff of novels.About six months into this whole adventure, with my dad asking me for some of that $5000 back, Dave asking me to just come back to Chicago, my boss asking me to rewrite the articles of other writers, and my body asking for a break from too many late nights, I met a man. I hate that so much of this story takes place around my desperate need for a man in my life, but I have to tell it like it happened. Well, like it didn't happen since this is fiction, but like it would have happened if it had happened at all. I could try to slip realities, but really, they all turn out the same in the end.I was taking a break from bars and shopping for crab and chocolate at Pike Place Market when I noticed a film crew across the street at the pier. I wandered over to watch with the crowd on the sidelines. The guy next to me told me how he had been an extra the day before and he was hoping to get put into another scene. He had good cheekbones, so I assumed it was a good bet. We watched together for awhile until the crew started packing up and he asked me if I wanted to get coffee. That single coffee lead to a marriage proposal four months later. A wedding attended by my dad, my mom, Dave, his mom, and my new husband's very large extended family. I asked my dad to walk me down the aisle, most certainly offending Dave who had been there for me my whole life. But, he never said it out loud. It was just another silent burden I carried on my hips like toddlers. Eventually I also carried toddlers on my hips. I drove a mini-van, I went to soccer practice. I had no idea what bands were new, what books were just released, or what movies were at the theater, unless they were animated. My husband kept trying to get acting gigs and finally got a role in a TV show. He was gone for weeks at a time and I was bathing kids and trying to remember fractions. I still wrote articles, sent them off to be rejected, but mostly I cried at old romantic comedies on cable, and ate dessert alone after the kids were in bed.I know what you're doing now. You're rolling your eyes and telling me how cliche this whole story is. You're begging me for something other than a \"girl has big dreams, girl gets married, girl becomes mom, girl forgets who she is\" story. You're begging me for anything other than the rambling shit you've read so far. \"Tell me why I should care!\" you're screaming and slamming the book shut in a huff of anger. And I don't blame you. I don't know why you should care about a life where things went as things went and no one was happy in the end. Why should you keep reading? Maybe because you hope it will all get better. You hope it will all work out for the quiet fat girl who never knew love. Oh, that's a cliche too? Well, fuck you! Stop reading! See if I care.Except I do care. Too much. Which is why I kept trying to make a perfect home for a man who was slowly moving away from me. And once again I was too desperate for someone to love me to realize there wasn't much in it for me. That's why I hope you'll keep reading. Let me show you what's in it for you. We made it work for twenty-two years. Until our kids were in college, one after another, just like Dave and me. Dave, who had kids and a job of his own. There was still a continent between us and I missed him. When my husband got another role in another show, when he told me about all of the other women, when he made this novel even more cliche by being a cheating bastard, I left. I walked away and apologized to my kids, who only asked me what had taken so long for me to leave a man they barely knew. Just another absent father. I moved back to Chicago. And that, THAT is where this story will actually start. At fifty years old, and still a minor celebrity adjacent insignificant fat girl (woman?).","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"02-seedlings/making-it-up-as-i-go/03-chapter-three.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756130952416,"modifiedTime":1756130965112,"sourceSize":6041,"sourcePath":"02 Seedlings/Making It Up As I Go/03 Chapter Three.md","exportPath":"02-seedlings/making-it-up-as-i-go/03-chapter-three.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":25,"backlinks":["02-seedlings/making-it-up-as-i-go/00-introduction.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02-seedlings/making-it-up-as-i-go/04-chapter-four-interlude-one.html":{"title":"04 Chapter Four - Interlude One","icon":"","description":"There are many different directions I could take you at this point. I want you to stop and think about that for just a moment. In any novel the author can decide to take you on many different paths. It feels, for you the reader, like there was only one way that story could have gone. The book you read is exactly how things happened, but they never happened so there's no reason they couldn't have happened in a different way. You have no idea how many decisions the author made, how many times they changed a scene, how different the first draft may have been. The sign of a good story, a good author, is that you feel like the fictional characters are real, that you are reading the story of an actual event. As I keep breaking the fourth wall, I am obviously not that author. I just want you to understand how this story is a bit like the theory of the multiverse. There are so many discarded realities that I could go with at what I have decided is now the beginning of the story.I could tell you that I went back to my hometown, fell in love with a simple, common man and realized that I didn't need all the glitz and glamor of a minor celebrity adjacent existence. I actually wrote this story once before and it sucked like a made for TV romcom. So, that's not our reality.I could tell you that it was here I learned that I was a \"child of air.\" Someone who when presented with a special stone from my spiritual guide could travel through the multiverse trying to find the right path to make the world a better place. That my brother traveled with me (we were named Shelley and Byron in that story because of my love of the romantics) and there were others like us who just tried to find the right solution to the world's problems. In the end we would learn that it was art and creativity. Art and creativity that actually brought about lasting societal change. This is another novel I started once and abandoned. It's really somewhat cliche, so that's not our reality either.I could tell you that it was here that a bomb was dropped. That much of the world's water was poisoned and we were thrown into nuclear winter. That my ex-husband, children, and brother died of the radiation, and I went slowly mad with grief. Until I stumbled upon a small community forming a resistance to the government who had risen up in the aftermath of the bombs. A small community making change through, you guessed it, art and creativity. I found my sanity and we saved the world through art. This is a story I was going to tell through poetry, like a concept album. But, really, it's just another cliche isn't it? No, that's not our reality.I bet you are growing as frustrated with this as I am. Learning that every idea is just a recycling of an old idea. Every story is based on a cliche. Why even bother to read anymore when you've read every story out there twenty times already, just slightly altered in form and setting?Because that's our fate. As readers and writers it is our fate to take a story told again and again and somehow make it our own as it's recycled through the machine of our own experience and knowledge base. We could both read the same book and see it in entirely different ways. That's why my jobs as a book reviewer were bullshit. I would write a pan of a book and yet someone else out there may have found themselves in that story. Or maybe it was just a story that the author needed to tell. Reviews have their place, but they also get in the way of people finding their true loves.So, here we are. All the old ideas laid out and cast aside. They are not our universe, our reality. They are graves in the cemetery of ideas. Let them rest. Let them lie. Let's be bold and forge ahead. I could have told you this story from my twenties. I could have expanded on my marriage and my life as a mom. I could have told this very story from any place we have already been. But it wasn't what this story wanted to be. This story wanted a new hero. It didn't want a fresh faced twenty year old. It didn't want a struggling new mother or a woman on the cusp of forty.This story wants to break at least one cliche. Allow a fifty year old woman a new beginning. So, let me tell you where I went from there.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"02-seedlings/making-it-up-as-i-go/04-chapter-four-interlude-one.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756130977396,"modifiedTime":1756131009163,"sourceSize":4227,"sourcePath":"02 Seedlings/Making It Up As I Go/04 Chapter Four - Interlude One.md","exportPath":"02-seedlings/making-it-up-as-i-go/04-chapter-four-interlude-one.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":26,"backlinks":["02-seedlings/making-it-up-as-i-go/00-introduction.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02-seedlings/making-it-up-as-i-go/05-chapter-five.html":{"title":"05 Chapter Five","icon":"","description":"I was crushing hard on my neighbor. I thought that at fifty, I had left this side of me behind in the clubs of Seattle. The last drummer (Who would later go on to be a drummer for two pretty major bands, but as he was the drummer, no one really knew his name. Yet another minor celebrity encounter.) had fucked me in a janitor's closet and then called me a fat ass and told me to leave. It was the rare time that I didn't feel good about embracing my sexual freedom. I was always glad I had gotten married after that and became a respectable mother. Family gave me a place to do penance for my past sins. Every blown out diaper, all night crying spell, violent stomach flu that needed to be cleaned from the carpet, every night when my actor husband didn't come home and I was left with a teenager heartbroken over an ending friendship, was another bead on the rosary of forgiveness. It was another Hail Mary toward being a \"good\" person. In the end all I ended up was a non-person. Someone with a past she tried to hide and late night panic attacks that I had made a fool of myself for decades. So, to find myself lusting after my neighbor in my new life, was quite a surprise.My new apartment was small. There were two bedrooms and a pullout couch so the kids could come home, but really, it was tiny. It reminded me of when I was living in Milwaukee and working at the website all those years ago. But now I could appreciate having a space of my own. A space not taken up by scripts and mountain bikes, school books and backpacks. My mom had been nice enough to let me store boxes of memorabilia at her house so I still had some of the kid's old clothes and toys, but my apartment was unapologetically my own. My oldest had a good job in Toronto as a linguist. My youngest was about to graduate and start a master's degree in politics. They had their own lives and didn't need a shrine to their younger selves in their mother's home. A few pictures, some children's books they loved. It was enough to keep them close.Otherwise, it was earth tones and floor to ceiling books. A desk with a laptop where I was struggling to reclaim my voice. At night there were the faint strains of music coming from the apartment next door, if I wandered out onto my tiny balcony, I could hear the music even louder. Strains of Pearl Jam, Prince, Tracey Chapman, and what really hooked me, Rancid. Although I think the night I decided to knock on my neighbor's door, it was Lionel Richie singing \"Stuck on You\" that lead me like a cartoon dog floating through the air after a scent.I didn't knock on the door with any pretense in mind. I wasn't there to ask said neighbor to turn down the music or to borrow a cup of sugar. I just had to see the person who's music so often exactly matched my mood. I slipped out into the hall in my sock feet and knocked at the door. After a few seconds it was opened by a guy around my age, dark blue t-shirt, kind brown eyes, tasteful mustache that made me realize I had never kissed a man with a mustache before. I was so distracted by this idea that I didn't hear him say hello until he asked a little more loudly if he could help me.\"Oh, right, hi,\" I stammered. \"I'm your neighbor next door and I was just coming by to...\"\"Ask me to turn down the music? I know it's probably too loud, but your apartment was empty for months and I got kind of used to being alone on this end of the hall.\" He looked at me with a sheepish grin that tugged at something that hadn't been tugged in a long time.\"No, no. It was the music that made me come over, but more to compliment your taste than to ask you to turn it down.\"I bowed my head in what I hoped was a shy, flirty move and realized I had knocked on this man's door in pajama pants and an oversized Foo Fighters sweatshirt that had seen better days in the early 2000s. I hadn't really prepared to meet anyone, I hadn't really thought this through.\"Compliment me?\" he asked confused by my rusty social skills.\"The music. I've been enjoying the songs in your rotation. It's trippy how often they match my mood.\"He visibly relaxed and exhaled, \"That's so awesome. I was really worried I had been a bad neighbor. Although, I should have come over and introduced myself sooner. I'm Carlos.\" He reached out a hand and I noticed a tiny spiral tattoo between his thumb and index finger.\"It's nice to meet you. I'm Beth.\" (Of course I was Beth. Remember my father's obsession with thinking he was a roadie for Kiss? Dave's just lucky his mother didn't allow our dad to name him Gene.) I took his hand in mine and felt swallowed by the size and like I was caught in that spiral for just a moment.\"Would you like to come in? I was just about to play something a little newer. Maybe some John Legend?\"The mention of John Legend snapped me back to reality. That felt like music a man put on to lull a woman into staring into his eyes while he snuck an arm around her waist and slowly tucked her under him before she knew what hit her. And I was a long way for being ready to be tucked under anyone right now.\"Maybe another time. I still have work to do on an article that's due tomorrow to my editor. I'll take a rain check on the John Legend for tonight. It was nice to meet you though. Finally.\"He looked at me and I swear steam was rising off of his shoulders and his gaze and for a moment I hesitated and thought maybe I could be tucked under someone after all, but then he smiled, gave me a little wave and shut his door.I breathed out. And tried to remember if I had put my vibrator in my nightstand. I really hoped the batteries weren't dead.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"02-seedlings/making-it-up-as-i-go/05-chapter-five.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756131016827,"modifiedTime":1756131036376,"sourceSize":5636,"sourcePath":"02 Seedlings/Making It Up As I Go/05 Chapter Five.md","exportPath":"02-seedlings/making-it-up-as-i-go/05-chapter-five.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":27,"backlinks":["02-seedlings/making-it-up-as-i-go/00-introduction.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02-seedlings/making-it-up-as-i-go/06-chapter-six-interlude-two.html":{"title":"06 Chapter Six - Interlude Two","icon":"","description":"I can feel your frustration with this story. I can feel that you think there are many important things I have left untold. And you're right. You have questions, I get that, so let's pause for another moment for a little Q&amp;A. Just shout out your questions and I'll try to answer as best I can.Q. You mention how close you were to Dave and then he just falls out of the story. What's up with that?\nA. I think it can just be something that happens as siblings get older. We went to different colleges, we chose different paths. He was never happy with my choice to reconnect with our dad, even though I had no regrets about that. My dad had stayed clean and found fulfillment as a grandpa. I tried and tried to get Dave to just try with him, but there was too much hurt in him to look at what could be on the other side of it. Dave and I stayed in contact, we kept up with each other's lives, we visited and made an excellent uncle and aunt to the other's kids. I just stopped looking to him to steer me. And he never figured out how to allow me that space. There wasn't a falling out, just a drifting that felt like the glacial creep of the continents leaving Pangea, until we were further apart than we realized.Q. What about your mom? Where are the other women in this story?\nA. That is an excellent point. You're absolutely right. It has been a bit male dominated, hasn't it? I suppose that's a bit of a squeaky wheel gets the grease phenomena. My mothers (I always felt lucky that Dave's mom was as loving to me as my own mother, and Dave felt the same about mine. We call them our moms.) were nothing but supportive, strong, independent women who taught us that, in a male dominated world, it was the women keeping things together behind the scenes. I never grew out of touch with them. I talked to them weekly at least the whole time I was in the Seattle area. I asked them for advice, I cried on their distant shoulders, and I relied on them heavily when things were ending. They do deserve a starring role in my story. I'll take that into consideration.Q. I feel like I know more about a guy you slept with a handful of times in your teens than about the man you were married to for 22 years.\nA. That's not a question, but that's true. My husband was an extra even in our own lives. He was a walk on role that had a line or two and left the scene. I wish that wasn't the case, but I have to stick to the script. He was an actor and I never really knew which him was the real him. He was dedicated and charming and ran his hands over my midsection like he worshipped Rubenesque paintings. I think that was the real him. The first months of our daughter's life, I think that was the real him. Happy and content with a baby sleeping on his chest while he studied a script for another bit part. But, then he got the actual role. The actual come to the studio everyday and be a bit player in this sitcom. And people recognized him occasionally. And then that was him. He was a star. A minor celebrity who didn't want a wife and two kids. he wanted to be free to run his hands over the tiny waists of his co-stars. He wasn't evil. He wasn't abusive. He just wasn't. Wasn't there. I had experience at playing the quiet ghost girl, so I took the lines from my mother's award winning roles and applied them to my mothering, but I never made myself whole enough to ask for more. It was relief when he told me that it was over. I had been waiting.Q. What about your kids? Don't you feel like you should have stayed for them?\nA. No. I don't and I'm kind of shocked you would say such a thing in these modern times. My kids were 23 and 21 when everything imploded and they weren't stupid. They had lived with their father missing for years. They have lives of their own and wouldn't want their mother to continue in something that made her feel like an extra in her own life. I love them dearly, but honestly, this isn't their story, nor my story to tell on their behalf.Q. Your dad was so integral in the backstory. Why is that when he seems a minor player in the real thing?\nA. I know that Facebook has made it seem like we need to stay in contact with every person who has ever come into our lives and that they should have an equal role throughout, but that isn't how real life is. Just like my brother and I were closer when we were kids and lived together, just like Jay was the first man who showed me how gentle love could be, but faded into the past, just like my ex-husband now has a life separate from mine (we have stayed friends for the kids and our own peace), my dad was so important when I was younger simply because he wasn't there. He was a figure I had to make up in my mind. I romanticized him until his absent presence formed me into who I became. Once we reconnected and he stacked up one sober year after another, he was just a man. A man who I was grateful to have in my life, but he became just my dad and my kid's grandpa. He was integral to the backstory, just like Dave. Then he was just a part of the comforting background noise of my days instead of the out of reach guitar solo he had been when I was a kid.Q. You say you were this quiet bookworm of a girl, but you sang in a punk band, wore fishnets, and got fucked in backrooms of nightclubs. I don't buy it. Were you a wallflower or the whole fucking rose bush?\nA. You're question is framed in the mythical binary of either/or. I had to be this or that. One or the other. This is the fallacy of all or nothing thinking (yeah, I've been to therapy). I was and am both. There was something about that punk scene. Something about being in that band, that brought out a deep soul wounded howl. I let out every bit of the pain I hid from everyone on that stage. And I numbed the rest by fucking men who couldn't have cared less about me in dark places where they couldn't see me cry. I was the quiet bookworm, the saintly mother, and the howling punk rocker on my knees with a dick in my mouth. I am multi-dimensional. (Look up the lyrics to Meredith Brooks's song \"Bitch.\" Then we'll talk some more.)One more question then we really need to get back to the story - Q. You're not very good at this are you.\nA. Motherfucker, I told you I was once writing a novel that starred an alien trying to be a popular girl.

All of the rules and suggestions and even the grammar is all made up. It's designed to make it easy for publishers to publish your work in a way that makes them the most profits. Yes, it also makes for clear communication and that's important when writing an email, a letter, a news story, or an essay, but it's much less important in poetry and fiction. Play with word choice and punctuation and spacing. e.e. cummings, Mark Z. Danielewski's \"House of Leaves.\" They broke the rules and it worked. Sometimes a cliche is what works. It's what everyone understands. There's a reason things become cliche - they're universal. Yes, sometimes we want to find a brand new way of saying things, but sometimes that brand new way is so incomprehensible that no one knows what you're trying to say and then the purpose of writing - to convey something - is lost. Don't get so hung up on worrying about avoiding cliches that you don't write at all. On the other hand, don't worry about being understood or liked by everyone, because that will never happen. Someone will hate what you're doing or misinterpret your meaning. Everyone brings their own lens to reading and will look at everything through that lens. You can't control that. Write for you and your audience will follow. Sometimes there's a feeling or a flow to a poem or a story that transcends the meaning. That's a cool thing too.\nI was in a writer's group and the woman leading it had been sexually abused as a child. I felt awful for her that she had lived a life full of abuse. She seemed to put everything through that lens. I wrote a poem that she interpreted as being about a little girl who had been abused. No one else in the group got that from the poem and it was certainly not the story I was telling. Personal experience will influence the reader and there's only so much you can do to control that. You can't let it guide what you write. It's ok to write without the goal of submitting and being published. If that's what you want, awesome! Go for it! If you just want to write and self publish, post to social media, post to a blog, hide it away in a drawer, that's just as valid! You are not less than because you haven't been published by the gatekeepers of words. Some published work is atrocious and some fan fiction is incredibly well written. It's all valid and worth doing.\nIn that same writer's workshop I mentioned earlier, I came to detest editing and trying to defend the meaning of my poetry.

I don’t remember taking a step into a swirling vortex and riding it til it dumped me unceremoniously into an unknown life. I only remember the offer. That a man appeared as I was shoveling the snow for the tenth time that winter. That he seemed to appear out of the snowfall itself. Materializing as a swirl of flakes in a white down coat and jeans. Blue winter hat and shaggy surfer hair.He smiled and asked me if it was time. From his pocket he pulled a smooth stone and held it out to me in his mittened hand. I looked at his kind eyes, his open smile, the red of his cheeks from the cold. I felt relieved to find a sign of life in the swirling snow, the cold, and the silence of a February morning.He asked me why I was shoveling when it was still snowing. I said I wanted to get on top of it. Not have so much to shovel later. Besides, my afternoon was free and I had little other to occupy me. He asked if I would like to change that and he nodded toward the stone. A small, smooth stone of a pinkish hue. Swirls of burgundy brown.The stone that would abandon me for periods of time and then return like long lost heirloom. The stone that ruled every decision I had made since I was seventeen. Sometimes I would be away from it long enough to forget that it was waiting for me. On this particular afternoon I had been without it for over two years. Its memory had faded like the colors of summer were now lost to the white day. I had thought this time I was free from its influence.I suddenly remembered that he’d spoken, asked me if it was time, asked me if I’d like a change. I took a minute and thought about the last year. The last disastrous year, and I nodded.The kind smile grew wider and he held it our further from his chest. “I thought so,” he said. “Go ahead, take it. I’ve been taking care of it, but really it has always been your keystone.”I reached out my own gloved hand, realized that I needed to feel the smooth, cold outside of the stone for myself, and removed my glove. I again reached tentatively toward the stone. As my cold fingers came closer, I felt its heat radiating like tiny tendrils reaching to envelop my fingers and I felt a familiarity. I felt a homecoming in my fingers. I touched the stone tentatively and the air started to hum.“Remember,” said the man, “wherever you land, that’s where you were always meant to be.”In a swirl of snowflakes the neighborhood and the man and my snow shovel disappeared and I was being swirled into the very air that created every flake of snow, every drop of rain. I was swirled into a snow tunnel of glittering, majestic, choice. And I took a left.And now I’m here. Lying on my back in a field of wildflowers. My hand clutching the stone. Looking up into the face of the man in the mittens, only he’s wearing a t-shirt and the sun is playing against his shaggy hair.He grins at me, reaches down and takes the stone from my hand, tosses it in the air, catches it in his fist, and begins walking away through the field of flowers.“Wait!” I call. “Where am I?”His pace doesn’t slow as he grins over his shoulder “Right where you are supposed to be,” he calls back to me, then disappears into an arch made from the limbs of dense trees in what I take to be the entrance of a forest.I look around. Perfectly puzzled. Thoroughly perplexed. I was shoveling snow on a cold, windy, grey day and now, I am lying in a field of blooming wildflowers, with the sun beating like mid summer. Bees are buzzing, leaves are providing an orchestra to the day.I look down and I am dressed in lightweight flowered shorts and a white t-shirt. Old, battered sneakers on my otherwise bare feet. The man’s words echo back to me, “Right where you are supposed to be” and yet, no where I have ever been beforeThe trip is always disorienting. For a time after the stone leaves my hand I always feel a bit like I am a newborn. Nothing makes sense, my legs are uncertain under me, and the memory of what came before is like a fuzzy dream. There is never time to think about the decision to leave. Only time to remember that there was a reason I made that choice.I stand up and take a look around. I thought I must have been miles from nothing, but I see there is a town up ahead and a house not far from the field I have landed in. There are cars and buildings like the ones I have left behind, so the change won’t be too disorienting. I haven’t landed at the feet of a knight drawing his sword or in the space age emptiness of an alien world. Just another reality like so many I’ve left before. I take a tentative step wondering if this will be a day trip or if I will be here for years like the home where my snow shovel is now being used by a woman who looks just like me, but isn’t exactly me.I seem to smell saltwater on the summer breeze and I feel a great relief that I must have landed near the ocean. There have been places with no water and they have made me yearn to always live near the sea. Just as I’m pondering this, a man walks out the door of the nearby house, looks around, notices me and waves me over with his arm.“Come on! We’re going to be late! Unless you want to walk to the store, come on!”Another stroke of luck. Byron is in this reality. I always miss him in the places he was never born. He needs a haircut and his t-shirt looks like it would be better off in the landfill, but it is good to see him. It’s been a few realities since I could rely on my older brother.&nbsp;“Why are you roaming around in the wildflowers when we need to be getting to work?”“Ummm, it’s just such a beautiful day and I feel like I haven’t seen the flowers in so long. After such a long winter.\"“Did you hit your head on something while you were rolling around in the flowers? Winter’s been over for months, Shell. Now get in the car!”He seems a bit frustrated with me, but then Byron is often frustrated with me when he happens to end up in my life. As much as there is always love between us, there is also&nbsp; his need to take care of everything and my need to fight him every step if the way.I get in the car and turn to him with a grin, “It is so good to see you. I can’t tell you how relieved I am you’re here.”“Ok, now I know you hit your head in that field.” But, he returns my smile as he turns the key and a Foo fighters song from many a timeline starts playing on the car radio. Sometimes the jump is just right.“If you want me to pick you up for work, I don’t mind, it’s on the way, but could you be ready to go next time instead of communing with nature?”“Sure. Yes. Sorry,” I manage to stammer. “I just feel a little out of sorts today.”“It’s understandable with all that’s been going on. But, it’s going to work out, really. We’re going to figure out how to keep the store and how to continue to pay everyone and it will work out somehow. This was our dream. We won’t let it fail.”I wish I had some idea of what he is talking about. I look out the window at the town passing by. Not tiny, but certainly not a metropolis. Clean, well maintained store fronts. People passing on their way to wherever it is people go at whatever time of day it is. It was late morning when I touched the Keystone. I glance around the dashboard looking for a clock and see that it’s 11:30 am. So, not much time has passed since my toes were freezing in the fresh snowfall. I wonder what date it is, but figure I really should try to play it some kind of cool before Byron decides he needs to worry about me.I try to muster up a response to his cryptic words about a store. “Yes, I guess I have been more worried about it than I realized. I know we’ll figure it out. It’s just been a lot to think about.”“Of course it has. Not only the threat of losing the store, but you having to travel back and forth to New York to meet with a publisher that is making demands that seem very unreasonable for a first time author and they way you have been splitting yourself in two for months. Keeping the store going, writing, traveling. It’s too much. I keep telling you it’s too much.”Too much. Just my luck to have fallen into another existence that is too much. I was shoveling snow in the middle of a snowstorm because I had suddenly found myself with too much time to think and too many reasons to want to get out of my head and into my body in the middle of a freezing February day. If I was going to find myself thrown into a life right in the middle of it, couldn’t I have chosen one that wasn’t too much?I didn’t know how to reply so I just watched the town slip by, listened to the radio, and tried to figure out how I was going to once again pretend to be someone I had never met before.It was always hard for him to leave her dropped right into the middle of a new life. No matter how many times he presented the stone and she took it, he felt like he was abandoning her over and over. In the beginning, when he was the new guy and she was still a teenager, he had begged to be able to explain to her what was happening. Why couldn’t she know? Why couldn’t he just tell her that it was her fate?But the answer was always no. The answer was always that this is how it has always been done. The answer was always that she must choose a life of her own. The time would come for explanations, but not today. Not at the beginning. Not right after the choice had been made by the stone.He would disappear into the woods or a crowd or into thin air if there was no other choice. He had learned not to look back. He had cultivated a joviality in these moments that hid his ache in not being able to run back and explain everything. The ache that no matter how many times they went through this, no matter how much he knew of her heart, she didn’t know him at all.He was a ghost in a snowstorm, a smile on a crowded street, an apparition on a foggy beach, a familiar stranger again and again. A constant in her life, but a constant that only appeared when things went wrong.He had practiced exactly what he would tell her when the time came that he could explain it all. When they let him tell her how she was chosen as a child of air. When they had summoned him this time he thought it was for the purpose of explaining everything. After all, she had been in that place for so much longer than any other. But, as soon as he saw the snowy street, her slumped shoulders, and the grey of the sky in her eyes, he knew that it was just another opportunity for the stone to take center stage. It still wasn’t his time to tell her everything.The store turns out to be a bookstore on a quiet street leading to water in the distance. A pale pink awning readsTwo writers meet because they share a publisher (and an editor?). They live on separate coasts and have other jobs to supplement the meager income of their book sales. She lives in New England and runs a bookstore. He lives in California and does web support for his brother’s company. They meet in NY at their editor’s office. She is a huge fan of his book and sees him as the perfect man. He has not yet read her poetry collections, but he does after meeting her and gets the feeling they are very much alike. They go out to dinner that first meeting and stay in touch a bit long distance. A big book convention is coming up and their editor/publisher thinks they should both attend to get fans excited for their next books. Which they are both struggling to write. The end up spending 3 days together in an airbnb because the publisher thinks their books compliment each other and wants to keep them as a sort of “team” throughout the convention and thinks they should know each other better to do that. They do end up closer and finding that they feel a lot of the same things about the nature of life and maybe each other. Then they have to go back to their lives apart. And she has to decide what to do about the secret she hasn’t revealed to anyone.She isn’t sure how she got to this existence. She doesn’t know how she was shoveling snow on a sidewalk one day when a man appeared out of the swirling snow and handed her a stone that seemed like something she had lost although she had never seen it before. As soon as the stone touched her hand she became part of the snowstorm and opened her eyes into a sunny day in a wildflower field with the man walking away into the woods calling out that he hoped this one would stick. A man who claimed to be her brother called to her from a house and suddenly she was riding in a car to the book store they owned together and was living a life she was just dropped into the middle of. She wrote poetry to deal with all of the secrets she couldn’t tell anyone. How did she get here? When her collection was published, the man showed up again one night as she was closing the bookstore. In the hush of the books and the coffee smell and the night at the window, he told her her own story.That she had been here long enough now to choose. Stay or go. The stone he handed her was the key to her destiny. Every time she became uncertain about the timeline she was in, he showed up and handed her the stone. If it was time to move on, she was transported to another timeline. Another of the many multiverse that held another existence. She had been in the last one for many years, which is why she had forgotten about the stone. The longer she stayed somewhere, the more the memory of escape faded. But she and the stone were linked by history and he was her guardian through timelines. When it became obvious she was not in the right timeline, he always showed up and the stone always knew. After two years, he would show up like he had tonight and ask her if it was time. If she chose to stay, the memory of how she got here would fade. If she chose to go, no one would know as the her of this timeline would resume her place. How many times had this happened? She wanted to know. How many times have we had this conversation? What about my real parents? My real family? My real timeline? She demanded. How much history had he stolen to drag her through existences?As he had many times before, he gently explained. She was a child of air. She was born into an existence of smoke. She was fated to find the timeline she could do the most good. Like her ancestors before her, the only family that mattered was the one she chose. Yes, she had left behind other parents, other siblings, even a child here and there, but they didn’t know. They weren’t harmed by her choice to go. And it was always her choice. Whether it felt like it or not. She had been fated by the muses to move through the barrier of existence until she found the one where she could inspire, uplift, and create. In other timelines she had been a lawyer, a politician, a cult leader, a musician. A daughter, a sister, a mother. An olympic gold medalist. And in each of them, she had done some good. Some of them didn’t last 2 years. In some she knew sooner that it was time. In others, she knew it was time, but she was hesitant to go. In the last timeline, she had been an activist with a large family and a husband and child. he had come to her at the two year point and she had told him that she believed this was the one. This was where she could do the most good. He had taken the stone and believed that would be the last time he saw her. That he would now be the guardian of another child of air. Oh, yes. There were others. Her true sisters and brothers. But, then her husband had had an affair and in her despair, she had stopped being active in trying to change her community. The day she had been out shoveling snow, she had just taken a job as a cashier in a grocery store to pay the bills. Her child had just told her that she wanted to live with her dad and his new girlfriend. And life had taken one of those turns that life sometimes takes. That lets us know we are not on the right path. Most humans either decide to make a major change and maybe turn things around or they settle into the despair and disappear into themselves.But she, as a child of air, as one chosen to do all they can to make change, she had another choice. And that morning in the swirling snow, she had made it without even realizing it. The stone had let him know and there he was again. On another street, in another town, handing her the same choice. And the part of her that remembered her purpose had taken it. And here she was. And now was the time to choose again. Stay or go.She couldn’t see why, if these were the rules, she would be given the option to stay in this timeline. All she was doing was running a bookstore that was barely solvent, writing poems, and falling hard for a guy who lived on the other side of the country. How was she changing the world? She posed this question to the man across the table. The guardian who had known her forever, but who she didn’t remember at all. Why this timeline? Why this existence? She had been an activist, a civil rights lawyer, a politician. Here she was just a lovesick poet. How could that change the world?But, haven’t you learned, that love and words are the only things that ever have changed the world? That they are the only thing that really matters?","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Epilogue","level":2,"id":"Epilogue_0"},{"heading":"Chapter One - Wildflowers","level":2,"id":"Chapter_One_-_Wildflowers_0"},{"heading":"Interlude One - The Guardian","level":2,"id":"Interlude_One_-_The_Guardian_0"},{"heading":"Chapter Three -","level":2,"id":"Chapter_Three_-_0"},{"heading":"The Original Idea:","level":2,"id":"The_Original_Idea_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"02-seedlings/unfinished-novel-the-keystone.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756131295680,"modifiedTime":1756131460229,"sourceSize":17610,"sourcePath":"02 Seedlings/Unfinished Novel - The Keystone.md","exportPath":"02-seedlings/unfinished-novel-the-keystone.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":31,"backlinks":["02-seedlings/02-seedlings.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02-seedlings/unfinished-poem-~-contemplations.html":{"title":"Unfinished Poem ~ Contemplations","icon":"","description":"contemplations on your mouth:your words slip under my tongue\nlike sublingual morphine\npoetic pain killers\nfor chronic ennui\nlips an awakeningcontemplations on your hands:touch like an understandingclear water ecstasy\nblessed by Freyacontemplations on your breath","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"02-seedlings/unfinished-poem-~-contemplations.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1755617483632,"modifiedTime":1755617550762,"sourceSize":273,"sourcePath":"02 Seedlings/Unfinished Poem ~ Contemplations.md","exportPath":"02-seedlings/unfinished-poem-~-contemplations.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":32,"backlinks":["02-seedlings/02-seedlings.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02-seedlings/unfinished-poem-~-simulation.html":{"title":"Unfinished Poem ~ Simulation","icon":"","description":"In the simulation\nrepetition is necessary\nfor smooth game playdoppelgängers\nprairie\nrain forests\nunknowable oceansthe repetition is necessary\nfor smooth game playdeja vu\nmonotony","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"02-seedlings/unfinished-poem-~-simulation.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1755617562830,"modifiedTime":1755617576742,"sourceSize":185,"sourcePath":"02 Seedlings/Unfinished Poem ~ Simulation.md","exportPath":"02-seedlings/unfinished-poem-~-simulation.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":33,"backlinks":["02-seedlings/02-seedlings.html"],"type":"markdown"},"02-seedlings/unfinished-poem-~-unfinished.html":{"title":"Unfinished Poem ~ Unfinished","icon":"","description":"I don't write in form\nI'm sorry I'm sorry\nI can't write in rhyme\nI'm sorry I'm sorry\nMy imagination went with the pills\nbut I could drive\nMy muse took to water\nbut I could eat\nI am dry\nas winter\nI am empty\nas your truth","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"02-seedlings/unfinished-poem-~-unfinished.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1755617588727,"modifiedTime":1755617600284,"sourceSize":231,"sourcePath":"02 Seedlings/Unfinished Poem ~ Unfinished.md","exportPath":"02-seedlings/unfinished-poem-~-unfinished.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":34,"backlinks":["02-seedlings/02-seedlings.html"],"type":"markdown"},"03-flowers/poetry/2023-autumn-is-a-rusty-birdcage.html":{"title":"2023 Autumn is a Rusty Birdcage","icon":"","description":"If flannel was pink could\nit ward off a rainstorm?\nIf green slept in your eyes would\nyou wake to new growth?\nIf blue was a watering can would it\nfinally quench your thirst for the sky?Autumn is a birdcage of rusty iron\ntrapping us between fire\nand ice, a resting place of\namber and gold.

Books not recommended by any list. Books that were in no way literary masterpieces. Silly teen romances or light horror, fantasy, sci-fi. Whatever looked like something I would enjoy.In my twenties I read chick lit, crime fiction, true crime, and whatever struck my fancy. I loved celebrity autobiographies, especially of rock stars.Then at some point I decided that I needed to move away from Bridget Jones's Diary and Motley Crue's The Dirt and get more serious about reading. Start reading well respected literary fiction or books from the 1800s (Pride and Prejudice 🤮) or sciencey non-fiction. I read a lot of books I enjoyed, but I struggled through many I didn't because I thought I should.(I did go through a period about ten years ago where I read nothing but zombie books. I'm not sure what that was all about.)In the last few years I have found myself not reading as much. Choosing books because they are what I feel I \"should\" be reading. Lots of non-fiction. Lots of commentary on society. I haven't enjoyed reading as much, although again, I've read some really excellent books. I'm sure I've learned a lot, but there were so many books I just didn't even finish.Then this month I read this:\n(One to Watch)Kinda chick lit/romance but with a protagonist who isn't silly or clumsy or needy. Grown up chick lit. I loved it! I read Resonance which you know I loved. And now I'm reading this:(Boyfriend Material)Definitely not an Oprah (maybe it's Reese Witherspoon doing the recommending now?) pick or a sciencey non-fiction, but it is so much fun and I'm rediscovering why I love reading.I think there's room for the non-fiction that interests you and for the classics, but there's also room for the cozy murder mysteries and the rom-com romps too.We need to quit being so snobby about books and music and enjoy them as they were meant to be enjoyed. Tofu and kale are great, but sometimes you need some Doritos or chocolate. If we've learned anything in the last year it's that life can be too fucking short. Read the damn romance, listen to some Harry Styles, and eat the ice cream.

Was it when my dad got Prodigy in the late 80s and I was suddenly connected to people via message boards? I made connections there I don't think my still analog brain understood to be different from real life. Through the years I had various blogs, participated in various message boards - sharing every detail of my life with strangers who I thought were friends, but now can't even remember their names. I was part of a digital scrapbooking community where I posted my kid's pictures and every detail of their childhoods. Nothing was sacred because the sharing felt intimate, like I was among friends.Enter Facebook. Now I WAS among friends! My need to share was supercharged. Surely these people were like me, knew me, agreed with me on every aspect of life! Wait... what? My cousin is racist? My uncle is a homophobe? Suddenly everything I thought I knew was tilted. And there was so much to take in and sort through and try to make sense of. Saved posts, watch later youtube lists, read it later apps full of varied, dense information that no brain is equipped to contain. Twitter, Instagram, more blogs, more ways to show the world that I'm here too and look at all the things I can do! Look at all the thoughts I have!Until there is no thought that doesn't get formatted into 280 characters. Will it fit in an Instagram caption? No one will read it if it's too long. Condense, shorten, shrink, twist into something palatable. Every word carefully chosen to impress - who? Thousands of strangers who only hope you'll follow them if they drop a like or a comment? Now it's not enough to create for the masses because I don't even know if the masses are bots. My brain is still living on 80s message boards full of the few people who had heard of Prodigy when the world has moved on to bot farms and buying likes.Yet, there is still the dopamine release from scrolling a feed and seeing people I \"know.\" There is still an illusion of connection and community. A brain that sees these faces as friends when they are complete strangers. (1/3)Until it starts to feel hollow. Until it starts to feel one sided and completely empty. Until there is the realization that no one really cares, they only want to be noticed too.For awhile I kept twisting myself to fit whatever would feed the algorithm, or make people like me again. For awhile I thought that sharing everything was the way to connect. Then, a stray comment read here, a thread read there - all causing me to hesitate or abandon completely anything that brings me joy because someone else said it's lacking. Said it's not real art, not real poetry, not real enough for a virtual world. They're right, just not in the way they think they are. It's not fake because they have put some sort of expectation on content creation, it's fake because it's content creation and not just creating.Here is where I find myself. 34 years into exposing myself to various outlets to try to find some kind of connection in a disconnected world. Feeling guilt when I don't share my feelings on every world happening, shame when I stay silent because I am empty. Still mining the old for something to feed the machine, since the well of creation has long run dry.Messages appear when we are ready to see them and I have had three in the last month that have made me reflect:i. In group therapy, the therapist asked, \"If your 80 year old self came and sat down across from you and told you what she wished you had worried less about in your life, what would those things be?\" My first thought was social media. She would sit down across from me and say, \"Why did you give up so much of yourself to the ether? Why did you not hold something back for yourself? Why did you let strangers tell you how to be and how to make? Why?\" I had no answer. Only the deep realization that she was right and that hopefully it wasn't too late. (2/3)ii. I read closely Women Who Run With the Wolves for my women's literature class. Among the very flowery prose and woo-woo Jungian psychoanalysis, there was a real message that spoke to me. Women have been taught by culture to make ourselves small, silence ourselves, and to let our inner instinctual voice be silenced. We have lost the ways of our matriarchal lineage and all of our stories have been hijacked by men and watered down. Crones made into witches, goddess religions into heresy. In the process women have been made to become dutiful, well behaved creatures who suffer from depression, anxiety, and ennui without quite knowing why. Our creative flow is disrupted by the voices in our heads telling us that we will be shunned or judged if we write that or sculpt this. Our creative rivers have been turned to sludge. Social media plays right into this by telling us what will please the algorithm or the platform (created by men) and we once again give our creativity and minds over to something designed to make us perfect homemakers, curators of the male gaze, and aesthetic influencers. I no longer want to create in this culture of popularity contests. I need to turn from the public eye.iii. My 3rd point will seem a bit hypocritical after what I've just said, but it was a comment I read on Notes, the Twitter-like part of Substack. How would the classic artists have created differently if they had to have a social media presence to be creatives who were noticed? Would they have played it safe and not developed their own style? The comment asked the question of whether art is about validation or valuation. Do I want to be validated by the masses for what I create or do I want to create something that has lasting value for myself? I choose the latter.I have come to disdain the need to create a brand, an aesthetic, to even fit into a genre. I hope artists start stretching their limbs and trying new things. I hope they never stop growing.I've decided to stop creating in public for awhile. To stop posting anything art related whether that be collage or writing. I don't plan to leave social media altogether, just change the way I interact with it. I want to begin to create in private, in solitude, in a cave of my own making. I don't want to think about social media so much. I have no plan for the future where all of this is concerned. I'm not putting a time limit on it. I'm simply sitting with the feeling that for now I'm ok not creating at all or creating for my eyes only. This is very removed from the past reasons when I would step back from socials. This is not because I am running away from myself or cringing at what I've made. It's not because I want to escape. It's because I want to run to myself. I want to value what I make. I want to hear my own voice again.I've privated my Instagram account and it may become more of a place where I just ramble or share my personal stuff. I don't have a plan. I do want to stay connected to the people I have come to love. Not just imaginary connections giving me shots of dopamine, but the real ones who I care deeply about. Our journeys have crossed paths for too long to go it alone now.

When in our youth we held our emotions on the fabric of our sleeve and felt as if we had discovered sadness and anger. When we looked at the world as if it was ours and just knew that we could be the ones to change it. How we thought we’d live on mars and drive a flying car and come back to reunions as rock stars in skinny slinky dresses with a movie star on our arm.Remember when we believed in all of the feelings we felt before people started telling us that feeling them was wrong? When they started telling us we were naive or emo and how you can’t cry at work or in front of people. How life isn't fair, so don't demand more. How no one was going to save the world after all so take your desk job and your pay check and go home and watch tv.&nbsp;We lost something along the way when we stopped believing in love and utopia. When we let our fear be the place from where we drove our heart. We were all those kids standing up for change. We were once those loud voices yelling for a better world. We were all ready to feed the poor and give voice to the downtrodden, until we became the downtrodden, or forgot the poor, or lost our voice.Change never seems to stick and the same problems that confront us now are just a new shape to all of the things that have always vexxed the world.Sometimes we stumble onto old words that fit the current situation exactly and we are amazed that someone from so long ago knew just how things would turn out. Knew just how we’re feeling now and we wonder if they were psychic, but the real reason they knew is that nothing has changed. We are the same cavemen protecting our clan from outsiders and feeding our bodies hunks of meat. We are fighting the same wars against different people. We are arguing the same points with different words. We are still barely getting by and dying and falling hard into despair.I can’t give anyone hope. I can’t bring anyone change. I was the hopeful youth in torn jeans and fresh skin.

Don’t you have better ways to spend your time? You write/create the same thing over and over Everyone is going to laugh at you Anyone who says they like your art is lying, humoring you, or just being nice You are not special/cool enough to be a part of this You/your art is not special, unique or worth it Whatever you do don’t write about THAT risque, dark, personal thing Keep yourself, your body, your feelings hidden Don’t talk, share, or feel too much You are not talented, pretty, smart, popular, trendy, thin, whatever enough to succeed You are too old/young. No one wants to hear what such a boring person has to say. Here is my response to most of those statements: If you are enjoying what you are doing, are not neglecting the people you need to care for or your own needs, are not hurting anyone (including yourself), then creativity purely for the sake of producing something that wasn’t there before is a more than worthy way to spend your time. Maybe it won’t make money. Taking time away from capitalist pursuits is good for the soul. Maybe it won’t change the world. We all need time to recharge by pursuing something that has no point other than making us (and maybe others) happy. No matter who you are there is an audience for you. There are other people living a similar existence who are grateful to find art they can relate to. You can never be too old or young to create. It’s not like being an olympic athlete or driving a car. There is no age limit and there is no prerequisite of having a certain level of talent or experience. All you need is the desire to create.&nbsp; If you create something bad, who cares? No one was hurt. No wars were started. If someone laughs at you because you had the desire to create, had fun doing it, and put it out into the world - those people need to spend more time creating something of their own and less time being assholes. Maybe you’re not unique. Or special. Maybe it’s all been done before. Maybe someone will think it’s garbage. It doesn’t matter because it’s about the act of creating and not about what happens once it’s released to the world. People may choose not to follow you. They may even block you. That just means that your art isn’t for them. Plenty more might decide you are just what they were looking for. You are enough. You are worthy of creating the thing that lives in your heart. There really are no rules. We have made up rules, but they are not real. You can do it any way you please. Fuck the critics and the people who say you’re not doing it “right.” Dare to break their rules because that’s the only way art will ever advance. It is really ok to use your time to make shit. You don’t have to justify it or understand why you want to make shit or explain to the world what your shit is about. You just have to go where your heart leads you. That’s the only way to be happy.

Each stage is further symbolized by a phase of the moon, and what the ancient astrologers thought each of these phases represented. The new moon waxing to full, as a maiden waxes to mother; the full moon waning to a dark crescent, as the mother wanes to crone. A Raisin in the Sun features three women embodying these three stages. Beneatha is the waxing maiden with an idealistic, hopeful view of the future. Ruth is the mother with her life full of the demands of others and very little time to think about her own needs. Lena is the wise, waning matriarch and the old ways of family life. Each of these stages informs the place where these woman make the decisions that will affect the entire Younger family.Because of Lorraine Hansberry’s early death at thirty-four, she never experienced all of the stages of a woman’s life, though she accomplished much in the time she had. Through Beneatha, Ruth, and Lena, she lived all of these milestones on the page and on the stage. Perhaps, with her background in activism, Hansberry was also saying something about the fight for equal rights with each of these stages. Beneatha was the fresh, energized fight for equality, Ruth the disillusioned middle generation who would like to see change, but is so tired of fighting. Lena is the old status quo way of thinking, where women make the best of their lot in life and are submissive to men. The man currently in her life being her son, Walter Lee. While his actions drive the plot of A Raisin in the Sun, it is the relationship and reactions of the three women that really tell the story.Lorraine Hansberry has said that she modeled the character of twenty-year-old Beneatha after herself.&nbsp; A young, radical, feminist woman with big dreams beyond the expected trajectory of a woman’s life in the 1950s. As Hansberry stated in her 1964 speech to the United Negro College Fund creative writing contest winners,“I wanted to be able to come here and speak with you on this occasion because you are young, gifted, and black. … I, for one, can think off no more dynamic combination that a person might be.” (Nemiroff 256) Hansberry could have been talking about Beneatha. Beneatha is the still fresh, idealistic archetype of the maiden represented by the new moon, a time for setting intentions and looking toward the future. She is energy, the discovery of creative potential, and the planting of seeds. In Act I, Lena asks Beneatha, “Why you got to flit so from one thing to another, baby?” Beneatha then replies, “I don’t flit! I—I experiment with different forms of expression—.” (Hansberry, A Raisin in the Sun 50)Beneatha has a dream to be a doctor and heal the world, and she has not yet been required to modify or give up those dreams. Beneatha has not yet had to shoulder the duties and expectations of the older Younger women, and while the true fight for equality wouldn’t happen for another decade, she enjoys opportunity not afforded to Ruth and Lena when they were her age. Beneatha feels free to express her atheistic views in the naive way of a younger generation who believes their opinions will be shared with everyone. Lena slaps her for disrespecting God in Lena’s home. After this exchange, Ruth says to Beneatha, “You think you a woman, Bennie—but you still a little girl. What you did was childish—so you got treated like a child.” (Hansberry, A Raisin in the Sun 54) This is how the maiden can be viewed by the mother and the crone, as someone to be corrected rather than respected.Hansberry said, in her 1959 keynote speech at the First Conference of Negro Writers, “I have come to maturity, as we all must, knowing that greed and malice and indifference to human misery, bigotry and corruption, brutality and, perhaps above all else, ignorance abound in this world.” (Hansberry, The Negro Writer and His Roots 11) Surely Ruth Younger has seen plenty in her thirty-two years of life to be exhausted by the indifference of the world to her suffering. In much of the play, Ruth is a mothering presence for everyone. She wakes Walter up for work, makes him get up on time, gets everyone in and out of the bathroom in an organized way, and makes sure everyone is fed before they leave the house. This mothering phase of a woman’s life, and the corresponding symbolism of the full moon, is when women are said to be at their busiest. It is a time to reap the harvest of the seeds sown in the maiden phase of life, to realize a woman’s full potential, to accept responsibility, and to practice selfless compassion.Ruth does not take her mothering lightly as is shown in all of the ways she desires a better life for Travis. While she has put a down payment on an abortion, it isn’t because she doesn’t want this new baby. It’s because she sees all the ways the family she already has will suffer and the mother in her wants to protect them all. Lena tells Walter, “When the world gets ugly enough—a woman will do anything for her family. The part that’s already living.” (Hansberry, A Raisin in the Sun 77) Ruth has moved beyond the idealistic, carefree years of youth and into the depths of life. A life crowded with work, household duties, children, the realities of society, and a settled, but somewhat troubled marriage. Her dream is a better life for Travis, and to take some of the tension off of Walter so they can enjoy their marriage again. She has been informed by three decades of living that have worn her down, but in the scene after Walter has invested the family’s money and her marriage is enjoying a rejuvenation, it is clear how much life and passion remain in this vital phase of Ruth’s life.Hansberry didn’t get to reach the crone stage of life, although she said, “I wish to live because life has within it that which is good, that which is beautiful, and that which is love. Therefore, since I have known all of these things, I have found them to be reason enough and — I wish to live. Moreover, because this is so, I wish others to live for generations and generations and generations and generations.” (Hansberry, The Negro Writer and His Roots 11) Through the play’s matriarch, Lena, Hansberry lived for generations. Lena is the matriarch who demands the respect she has earned after a life of sacrifice. There is a belief that “older women hold the energy of the menstrual blood within their bodies and make internal wisdom instead of external children” (Pinkola Estés 504), Lena is this wise crone.Lena’s life stage is further symbolized by the Younger’s apartment. Once the rugs, furniture, and walls were new and spotless, now time has worn them both old and tired. Yet, like the apartment, Lena is sill a home and a strength for her family. She is the strong backed matriarch who demands the respect of her children, and the soft hearted grandmother who allows them their failures. The crone stage is symbolized by the waning moon, a time for release. In Act II, Lena decides it’s time for her to let go of her place as the head of the family and pass it on to Walter. She is ready to put her faith in the next generation. “I want you to take this money and take three thousand dollars and put it in a savings account for Beneatha's medical schooling. The rest you put in a checking account—with your name on it. And from now on any penny that come out of it or that go in it is for you to look after. For you to decide. It ain’t much, but it’s all I got in the world and I’m putting it in your hands. I’m telling you to be the head of this family from now on like you supposed to be.” (Hansberry, A Raisin in the Sun 107) Her only dream is a little garden with enough sunshine to grow some flowers, and a home for her family.Throughout A Raisin in the Sun, the Younger women are met with challenges to the family, to their dreams, and to their small sense of security, especially through the actions of Walter Lee. Their different ways of dealing with their struggles are most pronounced in Act III when they discover Walter has lost all of the money they had left for Beneatha’s schooling and for the family’s future. In this act we can almost see Beneatha cross a threshold from naive maiden to informed woman. In the scene with Asagai, Beneatha is mourning the loss of her dream, the loss of her medical school money through events outside of her control. She’s ready to give up on school, on being a doctor, on saving the world, until Asagai asks her if she had earned the money. Had that money truly been hers to lose? “Then isn’t there something wrong in a house—in a world—where all dreams, good or bad, must depend on the death of a man?” (Hansberry, A Raisin in the Sun 134) Beneatha is furious, as she should be, at Walter. She is ready to forsake him as her brother, yet the burgeoning woman in her sees the truth of this statement.Ruth, on the other hand, is ready to look past this incident as long as she can still achieve her dream of getting the family out of the ghetto. When Lena decides that they aren’t moving now that the money is gone, Ruth becomes desperate and promises to clean all the houses and wash all the sheets in America if she has to. Lena, who has already seen so much misery and sacrifice, is willing to tell herself that her dream was just too big. “Lord, ever since I was a little girl, I always remembers people saying, ‘Lena—Lena Eggleston, you aims too high all the time. You needs to slow down and see life a little more like it is. Just slow down some.’ That's what they always used to say down home.” (Hansberry, A Raisin in the Sun 139) Lena has decided that her due has finally come. That she needs to give her dreams a rest. She tells Beneatha that now is the time to love Walter. Now is the time for forgiveness. Now is the time for release of all the anger they have felt towards Walter. From anger, to desperation, to resolve, each woman’s reaction is somewhat dependent on their stage of life and the experiences that have had.Beneatha, the maiden, the energetic new moon. Ruth, the mother, the surrendering full moon, and Lena, the waxing crescent due her rest and release from worry. Menstruation, birth, and the ceasing of the reproductive years, and the moon symbolism that has come to represent each of these phases, can be a very powerful force in the lives of women. Each stage brings challenges, experiences, and subtle shifts in energy and relationships. Informing how a woman problem solves, how she dreams, and how she loves. Lorraine Hansberry gives them all a voice in A Raisin in the Sun, and through her they come to life and truly tell the story of all of humanity.Works CitedAmerican Playhouse, “Raisin In The Sun (1989).” YouTube, uploaded by Reelblack One, 13November 2019, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzfgwxENvLk\" target=\"_self\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzfgwxENvLk</a>Hansberry, Lorraine A Raisin in the Sun, Vintage Books, 1994Hansberry, Lorraine, “The Negro Writer and His Roots, The Black Scholar, vol. 12, no. 2, 1981,pp. 2-12Louisiana Public Broadcasting, “Lorraine Hansberry: Sighted Eyes / Feeling Heart | AmericanMasters | Panel Discussion”, YouTube, 22 March 2018,<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL6i1JBl9ps\" target=\"_self\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL6i1JBl9ps</a>Nemiroff, Robert, To Be Young, Gifted, and Black, Prentice Hall, 1969Pinkola Estés, Clarissa Women Who Run With the Wolves, Random House, 1992Savage, Linda E., “The Three Phases of a Woman’s Life”, Therapists of San Diego,<br><a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.sandiegotherapists.com/threestages.html\" target=\"_self\">https://www.sandiegotherapists.com/threestages.html</a>, Accessed 12 October 2023“The-Maiden-The-Mother-The-Crone.png” could not be found.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"03-flowers/ramblings/lorraine-hansberry-synthesis.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1728072156244,"modifiedTime":1755612196333,"sourceSize":11897,"sourcePath":"03 Flowers/ramblings/Lorraine Hansberry Synthesis.md","exportPath":"03-flowers/ramblings/lorraine-hansberry-synthesis.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":51,"backlinks":["03-flowers/03-flowers.html"],"type":"markdown"},"03-flowers/short-stories/bottled-up-wishes.html":{"title":"Bottled Up Wishes","icon":"","description":"We once drank starlight from fluted champaign glasses, on a balcony overlooking the lives of ten million people. We poured love into each other’s ears and let the sheets pool onto the floor as the streetlights threw shadows over bare skin. We drank black coffee at midnight and ate toast over the Sunday crossword, laughing when we could only fill in a third of the squares. I wrote poetry on his palm in purple ink so he could put me in his pocket when his hands got cold on the corner waiting for the bus. He felt like forever until the morning I clearly heard him say, “I wish you would just shut the fuck up so I can tell you goodbye.”“What did you say?” I asked, shocked because just last night he had told me how you loved the way I could tell a story.“I didn’t say anything, but I do need to get going to the bus stop.”“Elliot, you just told me to shut the fuck up. I heard you.”Elliot turned an early sunset shade of pink and stammered, “I, I, I don’t think I did. I do have to get to the bus though.”It wasn’t long before I was sleeping alone on perfectly placed sheets and throwing the crossword in the recycling bin untried. Elliot had told me goodbye a few days later. The forever kind, not the off to the bus stop kind. I suppose I should have told him at some point over the eight months we were together that I can hear other people’s wishes, but it just hadn’t come up. I had honestly thought he might be the only man in the city who never wished for anything. It had been such a relief just to sit with him and not hear a constant stream of things he could never have - a better job, a woman with bigger boobs, a catamaran in the Bahamas. It hurt like hell when the first thing he wished for was for me to shut up.I gave myself a week to stream whole seasons of heartbreak and to sleep wrapped in the dress shirts he had left behind, inhaling what I knew was detergent but pretending it was him. I knew I was healing when I picked up a romance novel and lost myself in the steam. I went back to work the next day and only cried a little when I heard the girl at the next desk say, “I wish my husband would stop wanting to cuddle all the time. I just need some space.”Oh the wishes of the married and secure who didn’t remember what it was like to reach over in the middle of the night and feel nothing but a cold spot and a sense of something missing. Oh how I wished I could accept that cuddling in her place.As I left work for the day I couldn’t resist stopping at her desk and saying, “Enjoy it while you have it, sister. It could all be gone tomorrow.”That might be why everyone at my company avoided me at the Christmas party and the annual picnic, but since I was the only one who knew how to fix our archaic computer system, they had to at least pretend to be nice to me at work.I sometimes wish I could bottle all of these wishes and put them on a shelf in my apartment. Admire the different colors and smells of each one. Watch them swirl behind the glass and know that almost none of them will ever come true. I would especially like to capture the wishes of unrequited love. They are so loud and desperate and there are so, so many of them falling from the rooftops of skyscrapers, that I would like to quiet them with a stopper and never let them out into the world again. There are so few unique wishes. It’s almost always for love or to save a dying family member, which is really the same thing in the end. Yet they are all so earnest in their vibrations, they all are so badly desired that I once tried to make one come true, just to see what would happen.I was on the corner of 54th and Franklin on a hell of a summer day, checking my phone for messages from Elliot when I heard it as if it had circled directly into my cochlea. “I wish I had the nerve to tell him that I want to be more than friends.”I looked to my left and saw a young girl in a pretty strawberry dress gazing adoringly at the small, somewhat nerdy boy next to her. The wish weighed so much that I instinctively felt the need to set it down. I walked over to the pair and announced to the young man that the girl would really like to be more than friends. The girl’s eyes widened in horror and her mouth fell open and flapped around like a plastic bag caught in a tree in January.The boy only kept pushing buttons on the game he was playing and said, “Yeah, I know. But I just want things to stay the way they are.”The girl had run off in tears and I had vowed to never get involved with the business of fulfilling wishes again. Well, if you don’t count Elliot and the fact that I did shut the fuck up and allow him to say goodbye. Sometimes it happens accidentally, but it’s not like I have much control over that. I’ve also learned that much like my coworker who would probably feel neglected if her husband actually stopped wanting to cuddle, most people don’t actually want their wishes fulfilled and they feel a sense of guilt when they do get what they want. Well, again, except Elliot who hasn’t bothered to text me or even ask for his dress shirts back, which is a good thing since I took them to Goodwill with a wish that they would find a good home.I was tired of my silent apartment and drinking wine by myself on a balcony meant for two, so I did something I never do - I went to a bar. I avoid bars because the wishes of drunks are&nbsp; generally sex or sports related. Although there is often the one really sad drunk who either wishes his wife hadn’t left him or that he was a better dad to his grown kids. It breaks my heart either way that life only moves in one direction and we can’t undo all the stupid decisions our younger selves made for us.The bar wasn’t too crowded on this Wednesday night and the normal sound of the basketball game on the giant screen TV had been replaced by Lizzo reminding me that I’m a bad bitch who doesn’t need a man. I slid onto a stool and remembered how Lizzo had been Elliot’s favorite for about two months the summer before. I ordered a drink and slid into a memory of how it felt to drink with someone else when you knew that later the empty glasses will sit together on the nightstand while the alcohol lets you whisper your wishes into the hollow of your lover’s collarbone. How I wished that I could channel my inner Lizzo, forget about Elliot, and just take someone home and let the liquor do it’s thing.“I’m sorry you were hurt,” said a voice two stools down.“I’m sorry, what?” I asked.“Elliot. I’m sorry he left you.”I stared at the man with the kind eyes while the night stretched like old leather and I knew then how naked the girl in the strawberry dress had felt when I had exposed her.“I didn’t mention anything about any Elliot.”\n“Oh, really? I’m sorry. I must have the wrong person. It must have been someone else in here on the phone. I’m so sorry. Just ignore me. Too many drinks in already,” the man said with a gentle smile and a tilt of his lowball.Could it be true? Could there be another person like me? It couldn’t be a coincidence. It just couldn’t be. So I tried again.“I wish that someone else could hear the wishes that fill the air like gnats on a summer night,” I whispered in my head.I looked at the man. He looked up at me with a slow look of surprise and I caught the slight slur in his silent reply, “I wish that someone would take this weight off of my lungs because they can’t handle even one more day breathing in wishes in this city of so many lonely people.”I slid off my stool and sat down next to him.“I’m Mia,” I said, “and I would love to carry some of that weight so that you can breathe a little easier.”“I’m Arman and while I don’t know you that well yet, I think that Elliot must have been a damned fool.”Just then the door banged open and a young woman huffed into the bar, sat down heavily in a booth, and I knew that we both heard just what kind of a day she had just had.“I wish he would get hit by the 8:00 bus! I wish he would fall off the edge of earth and asphyxiate in space! I wish he would be clawed to death by a million tiny crawfish!”“Here’s to heartbreak, Arman,” I said with a tilt of my Malbec.He clinked his glass to mine, “And to the gift of unfulfilled wishes.”July 8, 2023<img alt=\"Bottled Up Wishes.png\" src=\"media/writing/bottled-up-wishes.png\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"03-flowers/short-stories/bottled-up-wishes.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["media/writing/bottled-up-wishes.html"],"createdTime":1703171610000,"modifiedTime":1755622125376,"sourceSize":8449,"sourcePath":"03 Flowers/short stories/Bottled Up Wishes.md","exportPath":"03-flowers/short-stories/bottled-up-wishes.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":53,"backlinks":["03-flowers/03-flowers.html"],"type":"markdown"},"03-flowers/short-stories/denial.html":{"title":"Denial","icon":"","description":"Logan had just gotten a haircut that morning. He’d called his friend Aisha and made plans to meet her for lunch next week. He’d bought his dog a new leash and collar and told Aisha he was going to take the dog for more walks to get them both in better shape. Three days later he washed up on the shore of Lake Michigan with no signs of foul play, his death eventually ruled accidental. He’d been drunk, maybe he fell in, it happened all the time. Aisha kept his dog, attended his memorial, and wept with his family at the seemingly pointless way of things, and life in the city went on. Only the man who read about it in on the Chicago Tribune website a week later knew the truth, scowling as he put his keys in his pocket and went out for another night on the town.As he passed bar after bar, the streetlights making the night feel like day, he puzzled over whether or not he could count this “Logan” as the first. It felt a bit hollow, a bit unfinished. It certainly hadn’t felt like he was sure the first one would have felt. He had envisioned everything about the night, right down to the Nirvana t-shirt he had worn, the one with the smiley face, but that was the only thing that had gone as planned. He was supposed to have persuaded the guy to get in his car, taken him to Osterman Beach and filleted him like a fresh caught trout before he dumped him into Lake Michigan as fish food, but this “Logan” had ruined the whole thing with his $200 haircut and his problems and his secrets. This “Logan” who had denied him his relief.He pulled his freshly detailed car up to the curb outside of The Green Mill, tried to calm his racing heart, and let his eyes scan the crowd for the loner, the person no one would miss right away. The man with just the right amount of stumble to his gait that signaled he had drank more than he planned and now needed a ride home to sleep it off. This is where it had all gone wrong with that “Logan.” He should have sensed the air of hopelessness about his prey, but instead he had rolled down his window, offered the man in the clean khakis a ride, “You’ll wait awhile for an Uber, dude, might as well hop in and I’ll drive you for less,” he had told Logan. And Logan had taken the bait. He’d collapsed into the back seat, but then instead of an address, he’d asked to be taken to The Belmont Rocks.“What do you want to go there for at this time of night? Come on, man, let me take you home,” he had kindly told Logan. “No charge. You just seem like you could use a good night’s rest.”“I could use a lot of things, but advice from a guy making his living driving a knock-off Uber isn’t one of them. I want to go to the rocks. I want to see the water. I want to remember.”So he’d driven him to the lake shore. It was the plan anyway, right? So what if the guy was going there willingly instead of demanding to know where he was being taken? He was still in control. He was still the only one who knew the ending, so he’d taken Logan to the rocks. He’d followed him as he’d gotten out of the car and weaved his way to the limestone wall that lined the lake shore. He’d watched as Logan watched the water, pulled at his hair, and cried out in an agony that came from some ancient place in his DNA, and he’d felt compelled to know where this grief originated. He wanted to know if he’d be doing his victim a favor rather than robbing him of something precious.“Hey, man, do you want to talk about it? Come away from the rocks, I’m afraid you’ll fall in. Maybe it would help to talk to someone, especially a stranger, you know? Leave it with someone who doesn’t even know ya. Then I’ll take you home. Just step back and let’s talk.”Logan had backed up a few feet, run his fingers through that too perfect hair again, and had said in almost a whisper, “It’s all a lie. It’s all been a lie.”The city lights stood at a distance as if waiting to be invited to the conversation, the moon&nbsp; hung low and tried to pull at the lake that refused to be guided by gravity, a star or two did its best to compete against the ingenuity of man, and the driver felt his fingers twitch at the thought of the knife in his pocket. He prompted his prey, “What’s a lie?”“All of it!” Logan yelled as the water hit the rocks with a surprising force. “My whole life! These pressed clothes, my high-rise condo! The whole fucking thing! This place! This place is the only truth. The only place where I can feel free.”“The rocks? Why here, man? What’s here for you but crumbling limestone and pollution?”“They used to come here when they had no where else to go. People like me. They came here because it’s where they could be a part of something. I don’t know that I’m a part of anything! No one knows who I am! It’s supposed to be ok now, you know? It’s supposed to be accepted! But here I am with a job and a dog and friends, and the risk of losing everything if I tell anyone. I’d rather sacrifice myself to the ghosts than keep on this way!”“Ah, I see. In the closet, huh? Why? No one cares anymore, right? They even have that rainbow shit at Target now. They have that show with the five dudes who make people pretty. It’s all good, my man.” Why was he trying to talk this guy down? Why did he genuinely want him to feel ok with who he was? He came here to cut him open and count the rings of his life, not to teach him self love, but he knew what it was to live with secrets and he knew what it took to quiet them and keep them hidden. Mostly he wanted the guy to not want to die so the killing would satisfy the need to take something someone dearly wanted to keep.“You don’t understand. No one understands! I tried! I tried to tell Aisha. I tried to tell my mom, but they both brushed it away. They told me I just needed to meet the right girl. There was a partner at my firm who came out two months ago. They finally found a reason to let him go last week. It’s not as easy as you think! It’s not easy at all.”With that Logan slumped to the ground. His shoulders heaved as the lake soaked into his creases and the breeze ruffled his hair. “The people who came here were braver than I can ever be. Too many of them paid the ultimate price.”\n“So this is how you honor them? By giving up? By throwing yourself into a watery grave? This is how you remember the ones who gave everything and were left to waste away? This is how you honor your past? Man, I think maybe you’re better than that. I think you came here to let the ghosts guide you. Not to join them, but to be joined to them. But what do I know? I’m just a knock-off Uber driver in a vintage Nirvana shirt.”Logan gave a shadow of a smile, “Vintage? I saw that same shirt at Target last week, right next to the rainbow shit, as you call it.”Logan walked onto the rocks and stared out at the darkness waiting to swallow him whole. He exhaled the last of the whiskey he’d drank an hour earlier, and said, “You know, I flirted with a very nice man tonight. I just bought my dog a new leash.” He was silent for a few crashes of the tide.“Maybe you’re right. Maybe it was fate that put me in your car tonight. Maybe… maybe I can find a way to stop pretending. If not, I guess this place will still be here next week. Take me home. Please.” He turned to face the driver only to be met with moonlight reflecting off a blade just inches from his face.“What the… Why??”“I’m sorry, man, really. It’s not you. In fact, I thought about just taking you home, but it has to be tonight, see? It was supposed to be tonight. But, this has nothing to do with who you are, really. I’m a lotta things, but I’m not a bigot. It just had to be tonight. It has to be now. I’ve waited too long. I’m really sorry.”“Then why didn’t you just let me kill myself? Why talk me out of it?”“It has to be me who decides! It has to be me who does the killing!”The driver slammed his hand against the steering wheel as he continued to scan the crowd outside of The Green Mile. He came back here because it was where it had all gone wrong last time. This is where he needed to be to make it right. All because of Mr. Perfect. All because that “Logan’s” foot had slipped on the damn wet limestone right before the knife had found his flesh and he fell as if in slow motion into the waves of Lake Michigan. He’d screamed for help. He’d flailed and fought the tide, but eventually it won. The driver had just stood there, watching. Hadn’t reached out a hand, hadn’t called for help, hadn’t grabbed his cell and dialed 911. Just watched as the body of his first victim was battered against the rocks, his $200 haircut turning into pulp, and puzzled over whether or not it counted. Were you a killer if all you did was let a person die? That was still what bothered him as he sat watching the last of the patrons stream out of the bar. Would this be number one or number two? He brushed a piece of lint from his new t-shirt, scanned the crowd, and vowed that this time he wouldn’t let some sad sack control the evening. This time he would be the one to do the talking and the taking. This time he would be the one to decide who lives or dies.He rolled down his window, “You’ll wait awhile for an Uber, dude, might as well hop in and I’ll drive you for less,” he said to the man with less than perfect hair. And to his delight, the man crawled in, gave him an address, laid his head back, and closed his eyes. The driver put the car in gear, smiled, and drove east with his offering to the lake.*Written for Creative Writing summer 2023, Professor BrunigSubmitted to Spire magazine, December 2023\npublished in Spire Magazine 2024","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"03-flowers/short-stories/denial.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1703043753000,"modifiedTime":1755622146785,"sourceSize":9842,"sourcePath":"03 Flowers/short stories/Denial.md","exportPath":"03-flowers/short-stories/denial.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":54,"backlinks":["03-flowers/03-flowers.html"],"type":"markdown"},"03-flowers/short-stories/fresh-sheets.html":{"title":"Fresh Sheets","icon":"","description":"Around a campfire in what used to be a city, in what is now the rubble of civilization, four survivors sit. Eating the rat meat they’ve cooked over the fire and a few rations of packaged vegetable substitute. Grimacing as they eat, the two who are old enough to remember share stories of the comforts they knew before the fall. The younger two think they’re making things up. Teasing them into believing that things were ever other than what they are now. Even if they were different, they could never have been as good as these two claim. But, the reminiscing continues.“My mother used to fry pork chops in an inch of oil! Man, I even miss the terrible greens she made us eat on the side! Couldn’t have the cake she made for dessert if we didn’t eat the greens! After dinner we’d head back outside for another hour of play before dark. Streets lined with houses, lawns, streetlights. It was just never dark back then. Now it feels dark even in the daylight,” Toby rambled on. “What about you, Old Lady? What do you miss?”I look up from my packet of vegetable substitute, the texture of green applesauce, and clear my throat. I don’t usually participate in these memory throwbacks, what’s the use? It’s all gone and it’s never coming back. But, something’s been on my mind the past few days. One moment I would love to return to even for just a day. I clear my throat and begin.“When I was a child I lived in a small house with six other family members. I know now that’s not very many, we pack people in houses twenty deep, but at the time it was unusual. I lived with my parents, my grandparents, my great grandfather, and my uncle. It never seemed crowded or chaotic to me, but I bet it was. There are so many things that I know you guys think that we elders make up, but it was true! It was all true! We ate dinner at a table together every night. Sometimes hamburgers and fries that no one had to cook. Someone just stopped and picked them up on their way home. My grandmother was a terrible cook, but I miss even what she used to make. My mother on the other hand could make a meal out of whatever you had on hand. I miss her Easter hams with pineapple slices. Don’t look at me like that, child! It was real!”“I’ll back up that story, Lady!” laughed Toby. “I remember the hams too! Butter shaped like lambs. Crazy shit!”“I forgot all about that lamb butter!” I laugh. “Maybe it’s better some things have disappeared. Anyway, it’s not the food I’ve been thinking about lately. It’s the beds. A soft bed all to yourself. A clean bed just for you. My bedroom in this house full of chaos was in the basement. We had divided up the basement to be almost like a little apartment.”“What’s a basement?” asked the younger of the brothers that Toby and I had taken under our care. Orphans like so many others. Headed for trouble like so many others. And trouble took on a whole new meaning when stealing was just a way of life now. Toby still had this crazy belief we could make the world a better place. Take in a couple of kids, set the world on a straighter path. I couldn’t see how they had a chance in hell of being anything but outlaws in a town with no walls, but what have you got if you haven’t got just a shred of hope.“Many houses had a main floor, level with the ground that you walked into. Then there might be stairs going up to a second floor. Usually that is where the bedrooms were. We only had one floor above ground in this house, but there were stairs that went down to another level below ground. That was the basement.”“You mean it was like dirt walls and floor? How didn’t it cave in?” Asked the older brother.“No, the walls and floor were made of cement. It wasn’t as fancy as the upstairs, but it was solid. We had these roll down curtain things that we put between the rooms we had created. A living room with a couch and TV, my parent’s room, my uncle’s room, and my little area of the basement. With a bed, a table, and I suppose a place for my clothes. The other part of the basement was for storage and laundry. Anyway, I didn’t always want to sleep in my area of the basement. I liked to sleep upstairs where it felt like a real house. My grandma liked to spoil me, so she would say yes sometimes. We had a couch that had a bed inside! The bed just folded right out and I would sleep there sometimes.”&nbsp;I paused letting the memory soak into my bones. I felt my body relax a little and I sighed. Willing myself not to tear up. Toby put his arm around my shoulders. Nodded his head for me to continue. “You’re making me feel more hopeful, actually warm with this story. Keep going if you can.”I nodded and took a deep breath. Another bite of rat meat. Grimaced with the taste of reality, and continued. The boys were wide eyed and leaning forward to drink in more of the past.“My strongest memory of sleeping on that couch bed was in the summer. It used to get hot in the summer, but not like it does now. Now you almost have to stay inside until the sun goes down. Then the days were long because there was no school, bright, sunny, and green. Nights were quiet, and cooler. A breeze coming through the screen door.”Toby holds his hand up to the younger boy who was about to open his mouth. Probably to ask what a screen door is. “Later,” Toby mouths.“The night sounded like crickets and frogs and smelled like fresh mown grass. I would climb into bed in that semi-darkness of a house asleep. Light filtering in from the outside lights. My grandmother’s sheets had the freshest smell. A little hint of bleach, a little hint of being put away in the linen closet for awhile. They were soft, and the blanket had a silky edge. My grandfather snored like a train, but it was soothing. Everything was safe and the future was certain. And I’d fall asleep secure in that house of people who held my history. While cars would pass occasionally, the frogs would continue to sing. And I would just sleep. That might be the most unbelievable part of the story! Sleeping without waking for a whole night. Sleeping without a look out. Just sleeping.”My voice wanders away and Toby stares ahead lost in his own memories of summer and sleep. The boys are quiet staring into the fire. The rats and vegetable mash forgotten. We all look up at the sky and watch the stars which are more visible than they ever were when I was a child. That’s something we have that’s better and we hold onto those little dots of light and dream of the other things that can be made right.2018","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"03-flowers/short-stories/fresh-sheets.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756133061531,"modifiedTime":1756133082311,"sourceSize":6637,"sourcePath":"03 Flowers/short stories/Fresh Sheets.md","exportPath":"03-flowers/short-stories/fresh-sheets.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":55,"backlinks":["03-flowers/03-flowers.html"],"type":"markdown"},"03-flowers/short-stories/ink-stains.html":{"title":"Ink Stains","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"Copy of Copy of Copy of Wordmark Substack-8.png\" src=\"media/writing/copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-wordmark-substack-8.png\" target=\"_self\">It was the way everything was ending. The way everything was over before I could fully appreciate the beauty of it all. The lights, the stage, the audience, the way they hung on every word. Over. Time to return to the underlying hum of the everyday.I stood in the hotel room for the last time. The weeks and months spinning around me like the color of old paper and I breathed in every dust mote. I tried to grasp every emotion that had made me want to write and share in the first place. I had written a novel. I had written a novel that people wanted to read. I had written a novel that people wanted to read and I taken it on a tour. And people had come to listen as I gave voice to my own words. They had stepped up to tables with the book cradled to their chest like a precious memory and I had listened as they gave my words a new voice. Listened as they told me how the story had moved them to tears. How it had settled into their bones and inspired them to make something of their own. To create something with their hands. To put their own piece of something out to the world. I had hugged them, held their hands, wiped away tears, watched their eyes light up when they talked about their own art. I had seen their art for myself. Carried carefully in folders and notebooks and read from screens. And I had cheered on every one. From the shockingly bad to the earth shattering good. Each one was a masterpiece and an homage to my own work, which I had only dreamed would light a spark when I was alone in a dark room with only the words to guide me.Weeks and months, tables and rooms, stages and hotels, and now... quiet. There had been friendship. Seven authors on one tour of book conventions across the country, across the globe. Seven people with different stories and styles and reasons for putting their words in order. Seven friends. Some better, some worse, but all becoming something to each other in the months of travel, exhaustion, elation and wonder. What now? Would these new friendships carry into the everyday? Would they survive the heartbreak and joy and breakfast and writer’s block of the day to day? Living on separate coasts, separate continents?Survive the introverted, focused life of a writer all alone at a keyboard playing out the lives of people having much more exciting existences than the writers themselves? Typing all of the things they could never be or say onto a little screen in a little room in a little life? For months these seven strangers had been someone else. We had lived the lives we had only dared to write about. And now... would there be enough to hold us together?I thought about all of this as I stood in a white room full of white furniture. White flowers on the white tabletop. I was a bruise of black clothing in this perfect room. I was a bruise of black moods in my other life. Every pure thing that came along was left stained by the sadness I wore like rainwater on my skin. The fact that I had managed to write a book that made people better instead of sad was nothing short of a miracle. My life was empty and black and the only place I felt I fit was in that small dark room in front of that screen writing about people who were infinitely happier than I was. I was an imposter on this book tour. I had laughed with the others and listened to their fears. I had leant a shoulder for tears and I had somehow, I still have no idea how, held onto my own. For once I hadn’t been the sad girl. I had been the inspiration. I had been the happy. I had been the joy. I had felt the joy. Away from everything familiar that made me feel like darkness, like night moving in, like a black spot in a white room. Which one was real? The person I had always been or the one I had become in a few short months? Who would I meet when I got back home? Who would the few remaining people see?What had he seen? Late nights when we sat in each other’s space, among the things that only meant something to us. Me in his room among the ink and color and storyboards. Listening to his soul pour from the speakers when he played the music that pushed him to draw his stories. Among his holy sweaters and ill fitting t-shirts. What had he seen? When he came to my room, a bottle in hand, a sheepish grin, a shrug when I mentioned our early morning. When he sat among my fresh book purchases, when he listened to the sadness pouring from my speakers. When he looked right at me and I was sure he saw the darkness and didn’t care, maybe even found comfort there. What had he seen? Did it matter now that it was over? Tomorrow we all boarded our own flights to be scattered to the winds, and this would only live in us as a remember when.I didn’t even know if he saw anything other than a kindred spirit in an awkward situation. The other five were real humans. Real people who could discuss stocks and interest rates and where they were vacationing next summer with their real life families. With their real life friends. They were solid and alive. But he was more fluid, more hazy, more ghostlike, more like the darkness that drifted into my brain when I was alone with my words for too long. Was I just a drinking buddy distraction for nights he’d had enough of the solid people? Was I the only one who felt there might be more? Would I board my plane tomorrow and someday write an ending that sold a book but left me empty?Back to the white room, to the bright day, to the glare of tomorrow shining in the window that dominated the room and brought the strange city right to my feet. A view that brought me right to my knees. How could I go back to my tiny life, alone with the darkness? Maybe I could just keep boarding planes and living in sterile rooms while I wrote about people in love. Maybe I could hold the reality at bay with my pointed words.A knock jarred me out of my mind and back into that too white room. A turn of the doorknob, a peek around the door, a breath of relief that it’s just him. No bottle. No sheepish grin, no shrug at the late hour. Just the sunlight on his hair and a genuine look of worry over his face. Come in, how was your last day, are you packed, are you ready, what will you do next, can you believe this view?Until I let one drop of the despair escape. Just one drop of overwhelm running over a cheek and he’s there. Arms wrapped around the black bruise in the too white room. There in solid form with a whisper of comfort and a hint of darkness hidden well beneath his holy sweater. A smell like old paper and ink and the coffee he must have just finished before he knocked on my door. A smell like ancient places I dreamed I had once walked in other lives I couldn’t confirm. I couldn’t let go. Even as he whispered that it was ok and that he wasn’t going anywhere, I couldn’t let go. Even as he promised we would stay in touch, as he promised those late nights hadn’t just been about loneliness. Even as he echoed my fear of what came next, I couldn’t let go of the place I had arrived after so many miles. He stood steady, arms only holding tighter, sweater only getting wetter, the white room only growing darker as the sun dipped behind the city.What’s next?Whatever we want. Wherever we want. Look at me.I can’t. I can’t let you see me.I see you. I have seen you for months. I see you. Look at me.{ Slowly, eyes meeting eyes. }I see you and I only want to come closer. I only want to sleep in your night.\nI only want you to stay in my reach.\nI only want to love you.Can you?I already do.And there in his grey eyes was a hint of moonlight meeting my night. There in his lips was the promise of just a hint of light to guide me. There in his touch was the healing of the bruises. The city rose up to meet us as we sank into the too white bed, two ink stains on fresh paper.November 27, 2022","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"03-flowers/short-stories/ink-stains.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["media/writing/copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-wordmark-substack-8.html"],"createdTime":1703046185000,"modifiedTime":1755745370384,"sourceSize":7932,"sourcePath":"03 Flowers/short stories/Ink Stains.md","exportPath":"03-flowers/short-stories/ink-stains.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":56,"backlinks":["03-flowers/03-flowers.html"],"type":"markdown"},"03-flowers/short-stories/penance-for-the-pain.html":{"title":"Penance for the Pain","icon":"","description":"The mirror was an old one, blackened with time, but Lucas could still make out his face in the dim light of the bedroom. He was hideous. His hair had thinned to streaks of an ink pen on a white canvas. A scar of waxy skin covered his right cheek. The red of his eyes was only made worse by the empty bottle at his feet. He carried a constant pain in his right cheek from a rotten molar and he cherished the pain as penance for his sins. He held it tight like a mouthful of Hail Marys, each throb another bead on a black rosary. He flipped up the hood of his sweatshirt and turned away from his reflection, relief flooding through him that this time the mirror hadn’t turned into a windshield flying toward his face, and that he wouldn’t have to look again until tomorrow morning when he’d dress to face another day that didn’t want him in it. Everyday since the accident had been a day that didn’t want him here. He was supposed to have died with them that night, but here he was, preparing for another visit to a couch, a bright room that saw his every flaw, and a man who never listened when Lucas asked him not to look so closely.He walked to the kitchen where he could still smell the memory of steak and Elena’s body wash. He shook out the pills the doctor had prescribed and washed them down with yesterday’s cold coffee. He felt their movement all the way down his throat as if they too wanted to seal off his share of air. He shut his eyes and for an instant the kitchen seemed to melt around him, replaced with a wet street soaking into his pant legs, blood pouring over his hands, and the smell of gas registering like an alarm in his amygdala telling him to flee. His breath quickened and his eyes shot open, searching for five things in the room he could see, hear, and touch, just as the doctor had instructed. When his breath slowed, Lucas grabbed his backpack and set out through his old neighborhood.The potted flowers on the steps of his townhouse were long dead, the chipped paint on the white railing revealed a patina of old metal beneath. As Lucas started down the steps, he shrunk back in horror as the railing turned to bone, the paint into burnt flesh peeling back from muscle and vein. He squeezed his eyes shut as he had learned to do over the past few months. Wait it out. It was just a memory. It was just his damn, messed up memory. He hurried past the melting arm and continued toward the psychiatrist’s office. He could no longer drive or ride in anything with an engine. He no longer trusted anything but his tennis shoes on familiar sidewalks.&nbsp;At the corner shop, Mr. Peterson was putting up a sign advertising a sale on fresh cut steaks. Mr. Peterson’s shop was a staple of the neighborhood run by a gentle, welcoming man who chuckled at local gossip and suddenly remembered something was on sale when a customer didn’t have enough money. Over the years Lucas went from buying candy bars on his way home from school, to stopping in on Friday evenings to buy flowers and cheap wine to take home to Elena. He always remembered to ask Mr. Peterson about his son who was studying at M.I.T. Lucas had heard the pride in Mr. Peterson’s voice and he had hoped he too would one day speak of his own child like that. But his child never became more than blood on a street corner from a dead womb.Mr. Peterson looked up from his sign and gave Lucas a sad smile, “Lucas, it’s been so long. How are you, son? Would you like to come in?”Lucas caught a glimpse of himself in the reflection of the shop window, black holes where his eyes once looked to the future and a twisted mouth that had once made vows of forever rippled in the glass. Lucas didn’t know how Mr. Peterson could stand to look at him with his scars and his shame and his loss dripping like rain water from his skin.“No thank you, Mr. Peterson. I’m sorry. I have somewhere to be,” Lucas mumbled without looking up from the sidewalk. He wouldn’t drag Mr. Peterson into a life of pills, shrinks, and visions of mirrors that shattered over him like shards of windshield glass.This is why he kept his eyes staring forward at the changing stoplights. There were too many people who wanted to see him smile with perfect white teeth and to admit that he was the one who should have had a steering wheel embedded in his chest, since he was the reason Elena had been driving that night when the rain had turned to sleet, and the black road had turned to black ice. Because he had too much to drink. Because he had argued with her over the baby. Only a few more blocks. Only a few more haunted landmarks. He could see the windows in his peripheral vision, bulging outwards to look more closely at his sins. No longer a child on a bicycle in a long stretch of summer, but a monster hiding from the burning of autumn.Slowly the quiet neighborhood melted into a busy business district and Lucas tried to melt into the crowd of people with lives that hadn’t crashed and burned on a January street. When he arrived at the psychiatrist’s office, he stopped underneath the reddening maple to ready himself for what came next. As he watched, the shadows of the leaves became tiny lost souls crawling over the sidewalk. He could almost hear them calling out to him to save them. He closed his eyes at the thought of the soul of his unborn child drifting somewhere, alone, maybe afraid, and he wanted to scoop these tiny shadows into his pocket and take them home. Instead he convinced himself to look away and entered the building for another round of lies. Always “it’s not your fault” and “you can’t blame yourself.” Fuck if he couldn’t. He’d been doing a pretty damn good job of it for months now.Dr. McClellan’s office was blessedly dimly lit. He had no receptionist and the office was always empty at the time of his regular Friday afternoon appointment. He counted the squares on the beige rug while he waited with the magazines on mindfulness, the sign reading, “Please Silence Your Phone,” and the wall clock whose hands never moved. It was always 11:17 on Friday at Dr. McClellan’s office.Within minutes, Dr. McClellan, in his brown blazer and white beard, opened the door to his inner office. He waved Lucas in and settled himself in his leather arm chair, moleskin notebook on his knee, fountain pen in his hand, wireframes perched on the bridge of his nose. Lucas again felt the feeling of time standing still. He sat on the couch opposite the doctor and pulled off the hood of his sweatshirt. He adjusted his sparse hair as he sighed and steeled himself for what he knew was coming.“How have you been feeling, Lucas?” asked Dr. McClellan in his Freudian voice, an accent Lucas couldn’t quite place.“Like my brain is fucking with me. Like nothing is solid. Like everything is just waiting to melt.”“Have you been drinking?”“Yes.”“Too much?”There was no use lying. “Yes.”The doctor only nodded in reply. “Have you been taking your medication?”“Yes. I took some before I left the house.”“Good,” the doctor nodded. “It will help. Do you want to get started where we left off last week? With that night?”Lucas clenched his eyes shut, every cell of his body screaming at him to just get up and leave and not ever tell anyone about that night. Sell the townhouse, move away. Die a slow death alone and rot into the soil, if the ground would have him. Somewhere from outside the office he heard a ticking, like a clock, but the clock was broken he reminded himself. He felt his limbs grow heavy, his thoughts quiet until all of the self hatred was gathered in a pinprick in the center of his forehead. He began to unwind the clock.“I got off early that day. It was a Friday. I stopped at Peterson’s and bought a bottle of champagne for me and a sparkling cider for Elena. A dozen roses. Two fresh steaks. I told Mr. Peterson that we were going to celebrate. I got a raise, we were having a baby. Everything was going to get better. Mr. Peterson was so happy for us. I was so happy for us.”Lucas’s voice seemed to give out. He didn’t think he could continue. The ticking grew louder for a moment, his mind shrank again to a pinprick, and the doctor said in his soothing, unknown voice, “It’s ok, Lucas. You are safe. Thoughts, memories, they can’t hurt you anymore. Just go on.”“Elena was home when I walked in the door, sitting at the kitchen table with a notepad in front of her, writing quickly. When she saw me come in, she turned the pad over and said she wasn’t expecting me so early. I said I wanted to celebrate the baby, and the fact I got a raise. She didn’t seem excited about the raise which seemed strange since we were barely getting by with just the two of us. We needed the money for the baby. I said that. The money will help with the baby. The baby.”Lucas stopped again. A tear slid over the scar of his cheek. He barely felt it. He only felt a slight nudge of his mind from the hand of the doctor, yet no words were spoken.“Elena said I didn’t need to worry about the baby. I didn’t even need to worry about her. She said that she had done something stupid. She had been writing me a letter to tell me. She pushed the notebook to me and I read what she couldn’t say. She wasn’t sure the baby was mine. She was sorry. It wasn’t supposed to have meant anything. I wasn’t supposed to have known. I didn’t know what to say. We had a few problems, sure, but she had seemed happy. We had seemed happy. She sat looking at me with such sad eyes. Such beautiful, sad eyes. I left the house. I walked for an hour. I stopped in the neighborhood pub. I drank too much. In the haze I realized I didn’t care. So what? So what if the baby wasn’t mine? We could still make it work.”Another pause, another nudge, another feeling like he was suspended between ticks of an unseen clock.“I left the pub to walk home. It was just turning from a cold rain to a sleet. As I was waiting to cross the street, I saw a familiar car pass in front of me. Elena was driving our car and she turned her head and saw me. Those sad eyes. They held mine and in that moment I thought everything was going to be ok. We were going to work it all out. Our whole future felt like it was hanging in that moment.”“Did she stop the car? Did she pick you up to take you home?”“No. I… I looked away and saw that the stoplight had turned red while she had been looking at me. I started to wave at her to stop. She looked ahead and slammed on the breaks, but it was too late. The road had turned icy. And… and she slid headfirst into a truck that was turning left in front of her. The sound. Oh, God, Dr. McClellan! The sound! I don’t want to hear the sound!”Lucas could hear the gnashing of metal against metal. He could feel the teeth of the truck biting into the hood of their car. He was there on the sidewalk while Elena was smashing into the steering wheel and ice was falling in his eyes and he was running, running toward her to save what was left.“Lucas. Focus. Look at me. You are at my office. We are just talking. I want you to look at my face, Lucas.”Lucas concentrated on slowing his breath. He looked at the doctor’s face and tried to place where he had seen the man before. Not here in the office, but somewhere. He nodded that he was ready to continue.“I ran up to the car and tried to open the door, but it wouldn’t open. The man in the truck was bleeding, but ok. He got out and tried to help me open the door. We finally managed to get it open and Elena… Elena was, hardly Elena. The airbag hadn’t gone off. She was…”“It’s ok, Lucas. You don’t have to tell me those details now. You don’t have to look so closely at her right now. Let’s just move on to what happened next.”Tears streamed down Lucas’s face and mixed with the freezing rain on a couch on a street in a winter in an autumn, and he decided not to look away.“The man in the truck and I pulled her out of the car. There was so much blood. It was everywhere. The man said we needed to move away from the crash because he could see gas leaking and it might be dangerous. We lifted Elena from the street and I could hear sirens in the distance. We laid her down on the sidewalk. Her chest, her chest… nothing but blood. As the paramedics arrived, the fire started. It was so hot even from that distance. I felt like I was melting&nbsp; in spite of the sleet. The paramedics took Elena and I climbed in the back of the ambulance. The firetruck was just pulling in as we pulled out. Sirens screaming. Maybe I was screaming. The paramedics tried. They did! They tried! But there was no Elena left. There was only her blood mixed with our baby on the sheets. They told me she was dead at the hospital. I looked at my watch. 11:17. 11:17 on a Friday night. Because of me.”“Lucas, why do you think it’s because of you? What did you do?”“I left. I got drunk. I should have stayed and talked it out. She wouldn’t have been driving on the icy streets to look for me if I had been a fucking man and stayed and worked it out with her!”The doctor handed Lucas a familiar piece of notebook paper. “Or not. Read this, Lucas.”Lucas unfolded the paper and saw Elena’s slanted handwriting. It was the letter she had been writing, only she had added to it after he left for the pub. Lucas read that while Elena had thought the other man didn’t matter to her, he had. That she was leaving Lucas to be with him. That she was sorry. He refolded the paper and looked at the doctor, who looked much less like Sigmund Freud than he had when Lucas came in.“She was leaving me? She wasn’t coming to pick me up that night? She was leaving to be with him? I don’t understand. That’s not what I remember at all.”“Do you remember when you first came to see me you described what had happened? That you had gotten drunk and Elena came to get you at the bar? She had been angry with you for drinking when she needed you at home. How you had caused the accident? All I saw was a young man with PTSD and a head full of false memories. When the standard therapy wasn’t working, I thought you would be a good candidate for a new trial therapy. We haven’t been giving you Xanax. We have been microdosing you with a mild hallucinogenic which has proven very effective in the treatment of PTSD.”“But you told me I was taking Xanax. You lied to me! Isn’t that against some kind of Hippocratic oath?”\n“Do you remember that you agreed to be a part of a PTSD study? You agreed to undergo experimental treatment. I have your signature here.”“I don’t know. I don’t remember. I don’t know. I… I… She was leaving me. It wasn’t my baby. I wasn’t with her in the car when it happened. But I remember it so clearly! I have this scar.” Lucas ran his hands over his face, feeling only smooth skin, ran his hands through his thick, unkempt hair. “I really don’t know what’s happening. The pills! Is that why I’ve been seeing such weird shit?”“PTSD has been known to cause false memories. The hallucinations were an unexpected side effect of the medication that I hoped would resolve itself before now, especially the view you had of yourself. It seems you somehow developed an outer perception of yourself that you felt matched the inner you. Very interesting, actually.”Lucas grabbed his hair in his hands and looked again at the beige carpet where Elena now lay as if asleep. He began to wail like that January night as he slid from the couch to the floor and cradled her in his arms.“I’m sorry, Elena. I’m sorry I couldn’t save you. I’m sorry I couldn’t let you go before now.” He saw every detail of her flawless skin before her image dissolved and he was left kneeling in an ordinary office on an everyday Friday. The doctor reached out a hand and placed it on Lucas’s shoulder.“Now we begin the work of healing.”The doctor was just an average man, the room an average room, the silence not as deep, the ticking just a regular wall clock. Lucas nodded and sat back on the couch.“I can’t say that I understand anything that’s happened. I can’t say today what’s even real. It wasn’t my fault, but Elena deserved so much better. It all feels unresolved. It all feels wrong. Can you help me make sense of it?”“I will certainly try, Lucas.”As he left the office and walked home down the same uneven sidewalks, Lucas still wasn’t sure that the shadows weren’t trying to pull him under, but he felt the clock begin to move forward again. It was Friday at noon, the beginning of fall. He stopped in front of Mr Petersons’s shop, and caught his reflection in the window. Just a broken man with shaggy brown hair, teeth that needed brushing, and a body that could use a good meal. Lucas hesitated, pushed open the door, heard the familiar jingle of the bell, and stepped inside.August 7, 2023","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"03-flowers/short-stories/penance-for-the-pain.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1703171661000,"modifiedTime":1755622078919,"sourceSize":17101,"sourcePath":"03 Flowers/short stories/Penance for the Pain.md","exportPath":"03-flowers/short-stories/penance-for-the-pain.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":57,"backlinks":["03-flowers/03-flowers.html"],"type":"markdown"},"03-flowers/short-stories/porch-steps.html":{"title":"Porch Steps","icon":"","description":"I had come here to be alone. I had silenced my phone and locked the door, but I stepped out onto the porch to soak in the sun that had been hidden over the long winter. The cement steps were cold underneath my jeans, but the sun was warm on my face. My eyes were shut to focus on the birdsong and traffic far in the distance when the sound of a car crunching over gravel forced open my eyes.He looked at me out the window for a minute before making up his mind and opening the door. Climbing out in one graceful movement of flannel and denim, glasses and trucker hat hiding his face while he walked up the walk, hands stuffed in his pockets and his shoulders rounded in apology or defeat. Did it matter?He sat down next to me without invitation and I resisted the urge to creep a few inches further away. I wouldn't concede my ground to the uninvited. The sun shone on his reddish brown hair and made his eyes squint into the middle age wrinkles that were usually invisible on his round face. He sighed and looked down at the grey steps.\"I tried to call. I know you don't want me here, but I had to see you. I had to make sure you were ok.\"\"You just told me an hour ago that you don't think we can be friends anymore. So I'm not really sure why you are so concerned with my wellbeing.\"It wasn't easy to be angry with him. It wasn't easy to feel this emptiness where he had been for so long. Without looking at him I knew there was a mole over his left eyebrow. I knew that there was a scar on his chin where his brother had sliced it open with a stick when they were kids pretending to be Jedi. I knew that he was hurting now, but I couldn't bring myself to care or to ask why he had to turn that into hurting me.\"But don't you remember what it was like before?\"I wanted to remember him as he was when I first saw him. 17 years old, shaggy hair in his face so the world wouldn't look at him too closely. He was standing with his bandmates off to the side of the old dance floor of the 1920s ballroom turned punk venue. I had just walked in with my bandmates for what was a weekend Battle of the Bands, a local thing that had been going on for decades. We had just arrived for the Friday evening pre-competition competition. Basically each band got one song to wow the judges enough to even get a place on the roster. I was also 17 and completely sure that we would get about 30 seconds on stage and then we would be boo'd off. Yes, our competition were all local punk bands of mostly teenagers who were probably going to be awful, but I was certain we would be more awful.I had tried to talk my brother Dave. our drummer, out of signing us up for this thing because I just didn't think I was ready to face a whole room of punks. We hadn't been a band that long and we had only recently found our bass player, Steph, who thankfully was also a girl because I was tired of only hanging out with dudes. Now she leaned in and whispered to me, \"We could just leave. Couldn't we? I don't think I even remember how to play the whole song.\"\"It's a punk song. It's like 3 chords repeated over and over. You are more than capable of that,\" I hyped her up. Yet, I was drowning in my own doubts in this room full of tattoos and Docs and testosterone. My brother slapped me on the back and said, \"Look. I told you it would just be a room full of assholes who think they can play because they listened to two Green Day songs and now they think they're Billie Joe Armstrong. This'll be easy.\" Fuck if he didn't have enough cockiness for all four of us. I scanned the room mostly agreeing with Dave's comment. Mostly guys in skinny jeans and white t-shirts with a mohawk here and there. Until I saw him and his band. He was so scrunched into himself. A yellow t-shirt with some logo I didn't know, a baseball hat shoved on his brushed aside bangs, hair that hung over his collar. Old Chucks scuffing the floor like he couldn't keep still. He didn't belong here either. I could just tell.\"Hey - aren't those the guys from Social Index?\" Our guitar player, Hank, had been around the scene with my brother far longer than I had and knew everyone.\"Yeah! It is! Thank fuck we'll have some kind of competition,\" Dave answered as he started walking in the direction of baseball hat/old Chucks and his band. We all followed behind, my heart hammering in my chest because I would have to perform in front of this room and because, honestly, I had instantly developed a little crush at first site on Baseball hat/old Chucks and I would have preferred to stay across the room making up fantasies about running my fingers through his fringe. Instead I found myself following in Hank's wake while I pulled Steph along behind me through the scent sea of body odor and old beer.I'm sure the ballroom had once been grand and had hosted big bands in suits and neatly trimmed hair. The walls were still decorated with art deco flourishes and balconies where the elite would have sat to look down on elegant women in shimmery dresses and men in tuxedos. Now it had been turned into a punk scene that was normally dark and loud and often violent. Young men getting out their frustrations by body slamming each other on the ballroom floor. (insert Sweet's \"Ballroom Blitz\" here) We had played here once, only recently as part of a showcase of local bands. When we weren't onstage I was up in one of the balconies trying to avoid the flying shirtless bodies. I had no idea what I was doing here. I loved the music but hated the scene. I wasn't even sure how I ended up in the band other than Dave had convinced me I could sing and play guitar decent enough to be in his band. Truth was, I could. Probably better than 90% of this room, but that wasn't what this scene valued. It was all attitude and anger and I didn't have a lot of either.As we closed in on Social Index, one of their members noticed Dave and grabbed his hand in a fist and said, 'Dave! Mother Fucker, I haven't seen you since Graphic Blandishment imploded!\"\"Yeah, I was out of the scene for awhile while I rebuilt the whole band. I didn't want to make the mistake of getting in with a bunch of assholes again. You know Hank, right?\"\"Absolutely! Hank! What happened to Staker?\" \"Also fucking imploded. Our bass player ran off with our drummer's fiance. Shit happens all the time, right?\"\"All the fucking time. So, you guys know Andy and Steve, right? And this is our new guy Declan. Kid has a killer voice.\"\"Can't wait to hear it!\" Dave said. \"Other than Hank, we have our bass player Steph and my little sister Beth. Guys this is Cody and the rest of Social Index.\"I had been hiding behind Dave, feeling more and more out of place in this scene where everyone knew everyone and most of the everyones were dudes slightly older than me. I had noticed that Baseball hat/old Chucks, or Declan as I now knew him to be, didn't have the testosterone dripping swagger of the rest of the room. He hung back, looking as nervous as I felt. When Dave said my name I peeked around him and found myself looking right into the eyes of Declan. He looked sweet, a little sad, a little lost and a lot like someone I wanted to know better.And here he sat next to me on a cold concrete porch step 30 years later. Still in a hat, still in his Chucks, still looking sad and lost, but now that look was because I hadn't let him finish whatever he was going to say after, \"I don't think I can be friends with you anymore.\"Then he had the nerve to ask me if I remembered what it was like before. Which before? The one before we were just friends or the one before that when we were more?\"Declan, I don't know what you want. What do you want me to remember? Why are you even here?\"\"I'm here because you didn't let me finish what I was saying. I'm here because you got this look on your face like I had killed your dog. And I couldn't stand the thought it was me that made you feel that way when it could have been avoided if I was just better at saying the shit that's hard for me to say.\"He was looking at down at his feet, the ever present Chucks that he never tied all the way to the top. I knew everything about the man sitting beside me. That he loved comics but also novels. That he was constantly trying to learn a new language but didn't have the patience to see it through. That he had never quite accepted that he was a level of famous most people could only fantasize about and even then they got the reality all wrong. But I had no idea what he was thinking right now. I had no idea what he was about to say and that's why I'd turned and left and not let him finish whatever came after, \"I don't tink I can be friends with you anymore\" because I couldn't imagine life without him. I could barely remember a time I hadn't known him.\"So just say it. Just say whatever it is without feeling like it has to be some scripted grand whatever. Just say it.\"He sighed again and looked up from his feet to my eyes. \"I've been thinking a lot about those months right after we first met.\"Those months. I thought about them a lot too.Neither of our bands won the Battle of the Bands that weekend at the old ballroom. I will forever argue that Social Index should have come in first just based on Declan's voice alone, but he wasn't traditional punk and what their band was playing wasn't what that crowd wanted. It was what I wanted and luckily, listening to them over the course of the weekend persuaded the other members of our band that maybe we could do more than the 3 chord, 2 minute punk song. Our bands had hung out the whole weekend and it was obvious we all got along really well and that our members almost paralleled theirs.Cody and Dave were both loud and crazy and attracted the attention of every woman in the room. It's like they were both born to be front men and yet, Cody was a bass player and Dave played drums. Steph and Andy were both straight edge and took immaculate care of their bodies. They were both awesome people. but preferred to just play the music and avoid attention. Hank and Steve were too smart to be in punk bands and should have been in college studying physics or something. They would get into deep conversations about the universe or some new technology and lose the rest of us in their ramblings.Which of course left Declan and I. The youngest members and the only two who weren't yet legal adults. In fact, we hadn't graduated high school yet. Declan didn't give a shit about his grades and was squeaking by with a C average. He only cared about music which was the only thing he excelled in at school. I wasn't anywhere near the brain power of Hank and Steve, but I cared about my grades and thought I would go to college when the band thing didn't pan out. Because let's be honest, it rarely panned out. Declan's parents were on him to go to college too, but he was really undecided about what to do.We were both the quietest members of our bands, front men and women who had only reluctantly accepted the role because we could sing. The punk scene in our area wasn't huge, so we ran in the same circles and eventually knew the same people, and ended up at the same shows. We pooled our small amount of money to rent a shared rehearsal space and spent stupid amounts of time together doing absolutely nothing.My crush on Declan only grew as I got to know him and realized that he was as sweet as I thought the first time I saw him. He was also intense when it came to the band and could have a real temper when the other guys were being stupid and he wanted them to focus. He didn't seem interested in dating or having a girlfriend, only in getting out of high school so he could throw all of his energies into music. And both bands were getting attention and there was pressure to do some local touring. Declan and I were the thing that was holding the bands back since we had to go to classes everyday.One afternoon I got to the rehearsal space early and sat on the old paisley couch that someone's mother had been throwing away. I pulled out the book I was reading for English while I waited. Declan showed up not long after, threw his backpack in the corner and collapsed next to me.\"I can't wait for the next month to be over. I can't even concentrate on this shit anymore. Why do I care about Algebra and writing fucking English papers. I only want to compose music.\"\"I know. It's all a societal construct. I don't even know what I want to do with my life.\"\"You want to front a successful band, don't you?\"\"That's kind of Dave's dream for me. He wanted to be in a band and I happened to know how to play guitar and sing so here I am too. I really love music and the scene. It's fun. I just don't know if it's forever.\"\"So be a writer then. It's the other thing you love,\" Declan had said this so easily. Like it was obvious to anyone and it was true. I did really love to write and I was always talking about ideas for all the stories I would write someday. Yet, I was shocked anyone had been listening. \"Wow! I can't believe you've been paying attention to that.\"\"Of course! The ideas you talk about are actual books I would read. Not the shit they make us read in school or the shit in the bookstore. You should do it.\"He stared at his Chucks and was quiet for a minute. His face moving in a way that said he was trying to decide whether or not to say what was on his mind.\"Would you ever date a friend?\" he asked in a barely perceptible voice. Barely above a whisper. \"I mean, like someone you've hung out with and know. Would you ever consider them as more than a friend?\"\"I don't know. Is the friend you?\"He jerked his head up from his Chucks and looked at me with a terrified expression, \"Umm, well, I...\" He breathed out heavily, \"Yeah.\"I sat quietly for a minute wanting to savor this moment when my crush on him went from pure fantasy to reality. Just then the door opened and Cody and Dave poured in laughing and smelling like weed and the silent spell of just Declan and I was broken. His shoulders slumped forward and he muttered, \"Fuck!\"under his breath and then, \"I shouldn't have said anything,\" I realized my silence had felt like rejection and as he started to get up I put my hand on his arm and just said, \"Absolutely. I absolutely would if it was you.\"The rest of the bands showed up and it was music and more weed and laughter and chaos and Declan and I didn't talk anymore and I worried that he had changed his mind. But that night as I finished my homework and got ready to go to bed the phone in my room rang. It was him.\"So, I want to take you somewhere. Are you free tomorrow night?\"\"Absolutely.\"The next night he took me to a poetry reading which I knew he probably hated and which made it all the sweeter that he had thought to do it for me. We held hands after on the way to the car. I kissed him chastely on the cheek when he dropped me off. And then I masturbated to the thought of him that night. As I had been doing for months by that point.We hid things from the bands because it seemed easier than enduring the teasing that was sure to come. We were friends in front of them, but saw each other whenever we could alone. Things moving from chaste cheek kisses to deep tongue kisses and under the shirt petting in his car.One night I got cocky and invited him to my house because my parents were gone and Dave was supposed to be staying at his girlfriends house. Declan and I were in the middle of what could have become the first time for both of us when suddenly Declan was ripped off of me and dangled in the air by a very red faced, very angry Dave. A very amused Cody laughing his ass off next to them. \"What the fuck? That's my fucking sister you fucking little prick. You don't touch my fucking sister. I'll kill you.\"Dave didn't even realize who he had grabbed by the collar until Cody said, \"Dave, DAVE! Calm the fuck down. It's Declan, man.\"Dave looked over at poor, blushing Declan and then at angry as fuck me.\"Dave! I am more than capable of taking care of myself. You don't have to come in here with fucking guns blazing to defend your sister's honor! It's not the 1800s! I am perfectly capable of making my own decisions about this!\"Dave let Declan's collar go and Declan collapsed onto the couch next to me. \"All I want to know is why you guys didn't tell us,\" Cody said.\"Because you're all fucking assholes who tease each other all the time and find the most sensitive thing about a person to pick on. It's fucking brutal and we didn't want that,\" I hoped it was ok I had said \"we.\"\"This very fucking moment is why we didn't say anything. We're barely individual people in this group,\" thankfully it seemed we were on the same page.Dave had settled down and looked genuinely sorry that he'd made such an ass of himself. \"Alright. You're both right. But, I think the bands should know. It involves all of us if you guys break up and the vibe goes to shit.\"With that Dave and Cody left and I took Declan's hand. \"I'm sorry. If you want to leave and forget about us, I'll understand.\" I would be devastated, but I would understand.\"Im not going anywhere. I don't care about 'the vibe.' I want to graduate and make music and I want to kiss you and talk to you and that's it. I... I love you. I'm not going anywhere.\"I gasped and could feel my eyes get big when I turned to him. \"You... you what? You what?\"He took my hands and looked at me. \"I love you. You have to know that, right?\"I shook my head, \"No. But I love you too. Almost from the moment I saw you at the Battle of the Bands weekend.\"\"When will your parents be home?\"\"Not until tomorrow.\"\"And Dave?\"I shrugged. \"I have no idea. He was supposed to stay with his girlfriend tonight and she's a real bitch so she'd probably be pretty pissed if he doesn't.\"\"Do you want to finish what we started?\"\"I... I haven't... I mean... \"\"Me either.\"\"What? That's impossible! You're a cute boy who sings and plays guitar in a band. Every woman at those shows would want to fuck you.\"\"1. I don't want to 'fuck' them or anyone. 2. I'm a band nerd. No one wants to fuck me. And that's not what this would be. Am I pressuring you? I'm pressuring you. Shit. Nevermind. I'll go home. Shit.\"\"Dec. Stop.\" I stood up and took his hand. \"Come with me.\" I started to lead him to the stairs and up to my room. \"Wait. Do you have, you know... something... protection.\"He stared down at his Chucks again, \"Yeah. Is that bad that I thought it might happen?\"\"Fuck no! I'm glad we don't have to wait.\" I wrapped my arms around his neck and kissed him. He enveloped me in his arms. \"Let's go.\"And it was better than I had imagined when I had imagined him in my bed all those nights alone. He fit just right and he smelled like home and I didn't care about all of the other cliches that went through my head at that moment. I wanted it to last forever.\"What about them? We left that behind a long time ago.\"\"Yeah. But they were pretty amazing.\"\"Yeah. But you ended it. You were the one who wanted to be free. You were the one who left to go on tour and left it behind.\"\"I know. I stand by the fact it was the right decision at the time. We never would have lasted as two eighteen year olds being launched into the stratosphere the way we were with the bands. We would have broken up eventually and in a way that might have meant we couldn't be friends like we ended up.\"\"Yes. I agree. I was devastated at first. I hated you for about a year, but we did overcome it. So, why the fuck are you telling me that we can't be friends now?\"Another deep sigh and another scuffle of his Chucks. He adjusted his trucker hat and squinted into the sun.\"Not that I don't want to be friends. That I'm struggling to be just friends. It's killing me to see you everyday in the studio and not be able to tell you how I feel. We haven't spent this much time together everyday since we were 18 and It's reminding me of everything I loved about you and what a dumbass I was not to see it sooner. I will be friends if that's all we can be, but.... I really want more. We're both divorced now. It's the right time!\"I had wanted more for so long. And then he got a serious girlfriend and I had to give up and accept his friendship. And for a long time it had been enough.Once Declan and I graduated, there wasn't anything keeping us off the road. We started touring locally and seeing each other less and less. They were gone. We were gone. They recorded a record. We recorded a record. We got to spend time together when both bands got booked to Warp Tour but that's when it took off. That's when Social Index was launched into stardom and signed with a big label and booked to a huge tour. That's when Declan decided he needed to see what that was like without a girlfriend back home.I understood what he meant. I understood the reality of the situation and how it made sense, but it still hurt like fuck and I hated him with all of my being. Our bandmates took to our corners and barely spoke. Just like Dave had predicted that night in the living room. My band had my back and wouldn't see the the guys from Social Index, even when I told them that was silly. We stayed apart for almost a year. During which time we also got a record deal and launched a tour.And I came to realize that Declan was right when I was making out with the lead singer of the band we were opening for and his hand was inside my underwear making me squirt all over him. We had been babies. We never would have lasted through the pressure and ridiculous schedules of the road. Not to mention the opportunities for casual hook ups and tour bus blow jobs.Our bands were slated to play Warp Tour again the next year and it was there that we all started hanging out again. When I could finally tell Declan I understood and was glad why he had broke it off. When we went back to being friends. Over the years I dated actors and musicians and he got one steady girlfriend who wasn't in the business but seemed to understand the crazy schedules. They got married and I went to the wedding alone. And cried in my hotel room after with Steph holding me and telling me she understood. That she had always thought Declan and I were soul mates.I started dating an actor who was always on location which was fine because I was always touring. We got married even though we barely knew one another. Dave got married, and divorced, and married again. Hank got married. Steph married our long time manager and had a baby. Steve had a baby and then got married. Andy got married and was content with dogs instead of babies. Cody had been the cover boy for the whole scene that our bands started. The pressure was immense and the paparazzi intense. He took too many pills one night on Warp Tour and Declan found him in their room. He was sure Cody was dead. But, he made it and got help and had a kid. The years went on and we were at each other's weddings and celebrated births and had parties and BBQs and played music and toured and grew up and older.Declan got divorced first. After his wife revealed she had been seeing someone else for the last five years of their marriage. That fucks a guy up and Declan threw himself into being an amazing dad and musician, I got divorced a couple of years later when my husband and I realized that we had spent 20 years being apart and hardly knew one another. We parted as best friends and co-parents and I love him with all my heart, but not as a soul mate. That space has always felt occupied,A few months ago the record company realized that Social Index and Yeah!Nadia shared a history and a fan base and that it would be awesome if we recorded some kind of collab album and toured together. It was suddenly like the early days. We were sharing a rehearsal space and writing songs together and seeing each other everyday. The only difference was we were surrounded by family life. Spouses and kids and demands outside of each other. Declan and I both had kids at college so we were more flexible than those with little ones at home. We stayed in the studio writing or playing music together late into the night.And yes, I had thought that maybe I was feeling something again. But, I thought it might have just been nostalgia. I had gotten an electric charge when our hands met. I had wanted to kiss him when he was leaning over the control panel towards me. I had wanted to throw his guitar aside and mount him on the studio floor. But, I tried to remember the way it hurt everyone when it ended before and how much more we had to lose now.\"What if everyone gets hurt again?\"\"Does that mean you feel it too?\"\"Dec, I don't think I ever stopped feeling it which is probably why I married a guy I spent very little time with. I didn't have to face the daily guilt of being married to him and loving someone else,\" I stared at my own shoes when I said that in case it was too much too soon.\"I know that guilt. It's why I couldn't even be that mad when it turned out Mia had been fucking someone else for five years. You and I have always been meant to be. I just wish it hadn't taken me so long to realize it.\"\"You were right to end it all those years ago. We never would have survived the fame at eighteen. We were able to be friends again because you ended it before it could all go bad. Yes, there's regret, but our kids grew up knowing each other and the bands are all still close. I think you're right. It's time now.\"I took his calloused hand that had played songs for millions. \"Do you want to finish what we started?\"\"I don't know. Do you have protection?\" He smirked.\"I do. But not for my heart.\" I groaned at the cheesy line.\"No worries there.\" He kissed me on the cold porch steps and time righted itself the way it does when things that are meant to be finally... be.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"03-flowers/short-stories/porch-steps.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756133486606,"modifiedTime":1756133494951,"sourceSize":25935,"sourcePath":"03 Flowers/short stories/Porch Steps.md","exportPath":"03-flowers/short-stories/porch-steps.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":58,"backlinks":["03-flowers/03-flowers.html"],"type":"markdown"},"03-flowers/short-stories/the-letter.html":{"title":"The Letter","icon":"","description":"Dearest Ward,How the years have passed by and changed us both. How the time has made us into who we are today. We have lived lives unimaginable and now we are within sight of the finish line. What a race it’s been! How strange to have more miles behind us than in front.&nbsp;But, I’m babbling on and you, I’m sure, are wondering why I’m taking the time to write after all these years. After so much water under the bridge. Or maybe you’re not wondering. Maybe you have also seen the checkered flag awaiting you and have looked back at and analyzed every turn. And maybe you have seen the places where it all went wrong.You are my turn that went wrong and as I sit in a house built on other people’s secrets, a life built on other people’s pain, I am alone. There is no husband, no children, not even a cat to feed and take care of. There is only the empty regret that I spent a life immersed in the work of tearing down lives. Some deserved, some maybe not.Maybe that’s why you left. We all have secrets and you wanted yours kept. But I have the unholy compulsion of digging under it all and surfacing what people would rather keep hidden. I’m sure you sensed that there were times I was mining your past as well. Digging through your thoughts and actions. It’s what detectives do. But, I never seemed to learn when to leave that at the office.Not that there ever was an office or an official title. No place to hang out a sign. People just seemed to find me when they needed me. To seek me out when the solution escaped them. And I put everything together in a nice manilla folder for them. Tied up the loose ends and, even when the end wasn’t what they wanted, I always hoped it had brought them closure and peace. Maybe I would should have left well enough alone in some of these cases.But, I do know I helped people find peace and helped find people who shouldn’t have been walking free. So, now, when my eyes and ears are failing me and I’m no longer able to suss out the truth, I have had the time to sit and suss out mine.&nbsp;And my truth is that, even as I gathered clues and pieced together facts, even as I prided myself on being a woman “Sherlock” and seemed to see connections no one else could make, even as I was able to coax secrets from people, I could never access my own secrets. I could never piece together myself. There wasn’t time! One case would end and another would come. My mind was forever engaged in a world beyond my own! But, I don’t have to tell you that, do I Ward? It’s why you finally left. I was always the case I was on and never a whole person.I have time now. Hours and hours of time. I’ve sorted through old cases and locked them away. I’ve cleaned the layer of dust from my home. I’ve read the books that I bought over the years and never had time for. I’ve worked through the distractions in an effort to keep me from having to examine myself. Maybe that’s what all of the years were. A distraction to keep me from myself.&nbsp;But, I’ve had a look now. The woman I see is old! When did she get old? I barely remember being young! She’s alone. She has a lifetime of memories that belong to other people. Most of all, she regrets never knowing what a lifetime of memories made with you would have been.&nbsp;I’m sure you have a lifetime of memories of your own. You and Maria. I was so sad to hear of her passing, Ward. I was never the jealous type and she was an amazing woman. Maybe there will be a time, after you read this letter, when we can sit down and you can tell me about your wonderful life. You’ll have to do all of the talking, because my stories are only the stories of others.&nbsp;I don’t know what I’m asking for here. Just a chance. A chance to get right what I got so wrong! I don’t know if you’ll see me as worthy of that chance, but I need to reach out and try.&nbsp;I don’t want to die without my own memories. I don’t want to die with regret. So even if we just sit down over a glass of wine and talk about the old days, it will be at least one memory of my own to sustain me.I hope to hear from you soon, Ward.Yours,&nbsp;Stancile2018","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"03-flowers/short-stories/the-letter.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1756133335356,"modifiedTime":1756133407959,"sourceSize":4174,"sourcePath":"03 Flowers/short stories/The Letter.md","exportPath":"03-flowers/short-stories/the-letter.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":59,"backlinks":["03-flowers/03-flowers.html"],"type":"markdown"},"03-flowers/short-stories/we-are-made-of-endings.html":{"title":"We Are Made of Endings","icon":"","description":"I dreamt of endings. Frayed strands of yarn, a dead end road, storm clouds rolling out and giving way to blue, the check arriving on a scarred table in a pub at the end of the world. Every night the dreams began at the end and only faded to black like the last scene of an old film. I spent my daylight hours trying to recreate the scene that had come before, but there was nothing. No hint of a remembered dream pulling at the edges of my mind. Just the ending.Then one morning there was only the last bite of a muffin left in the box. The next day only the last sip of cold coffee left in the cup freshly poured. The following afternoon there was only the wrap up of a meeting. The next evening only the last mile to drive home. I spent my nighttime hours trying to recreate the scenes that must have come before, but there was nothing. No hint of a remembered life pulling at the edges of my mind. Only endings.A visit to my doctor, a referral to a neurologist, the last few minutes of a consultation, the table leaving the MRI scanner with no memory of going in. The assurance that everything was fine as the doctor left the room. Getting up from a chair in the psychiatrist’s office with an appointment for another session next week, maybe you have some unremembered trauma, we’ll discuss it more next time. this session was very enlightening. I was only left more in the dark. What had I said? What had I told this stern looking woman with the wire frames and fountain pen? I couldn’t remember walking in the office let alone the words that had left my mouth. Only the ending.Weeks continued on the same way. Dreams of last breaths, falling leaves, the sputtering of a wick in a pool of wax, orgasm without touch, so many backs as people walked away. Days spent consuming last gulps of coffee, last bites of food, the last chapter of every novel. Meetings wrapping up, arriving home without the drive, stepping out of the shower dripping wet without stepping in, hanging up the phone without remembering who I had been talking to. Back to the neurologist, “are you sure? are you sure there isn’t something there? look again.” Back to the psychiatrist, “it’s all slipping away. make it stay. make me more than a last moment. i am only an ending.”Finally opening my eyes to a sterile room in a white gown with tiny faded green dots, just as the light from the setting sun was hitting the dresser on the far side of the room, illuminating the vase of wilting flowers and a water glass with one final sip. I didn’t rise. I didn’t question how this had all happened. It was just another ending.I had often missed the first buds in the spring, a storm rolling in on a sunny day, my heart skipping a beat when I opened the door for a first date. I hadn’t savored being handed the menu to choose, reaching out to take a cup of coffee, fresh and steaming, lighting an unburned wick, turning to the title page of an unread book, letting my hands wander over a body I knew would soon be wrapped around my own. I had seldom thought, “this is the beginning. this moment is where it all starts.” I was made of forgotten beginnings.But the endings, when I was satiated, sad, shattered, thrilled, lost, content… alone, then I knew. Then I stopped to remember that there was a beginning to this ending. There was a spot where I decided I was all in, without the realization that life is just endings, as spring is just the end of winter. As I lay in the ultimate end, alone without even the memory of arriving in this place, I could only feel joy for the reminder that my life had been full of beginnings I never took the time to see. That the way the light was fading in the room was really just the start of the last night. Only the beginning.The beginning of the last night when it all became clear. When I walked out of the sterile room and saw every person who passed me as the joining of ovum and sperm, spinning strands of DNA, an atom of carbon. The hallway darkened to a single point of light in the distance of a cavernous emptiness. The faded dots of my gown floated into the darkness like fireflies to guide my body shed of clothing and worries.I followed as I dissolved into cells, into elements, into galaxies. I spun through the darkness with eight billion other swirling clouds of hydrogen and helium, light and heat, heavy with potential. We had been destroyers. We had been the riders of the apocalypse leaving destruction in our wake. The fellers of trees, the bullets through flesh, the plastic suspended in salt water, the cement over bones. We had been eight billion little endings. Eight billion little endings swirling into one cloud, one singular point of light, one spot blinking in a universe of unnamed black. A heavy mass of souls in a tiny singularity. Waiting. Just another beginning.{ Published in the 2023 Edition of the Elgin Community College Spire Literary Magazine}<img alt=\"stardust.jpeg\" src=\"media/writing/stardust.jpeg\"

Thoughts","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"thoughts.png\" src=\"media/thoughts.png\" target=\"_self\">\n(spring) Spring fell in three days of relentless rain. Soaking the first sprouts and turning yards to fresh mud. While we waited for the leaves, the birds filled the trees instead, with long awaited song. Soon the colors will wake from their long sleep, and we will believe that hope is what made it all bloom once more. (crone) I had a revelation last night about how I've gone through life never feeling good enough because I have based my worth on whether or not I'd be seen as attractive to a man. Last night I was like, fuck this. I want to be a wise old crone with waves of grey hair and mala beads wrapped around the skin of my crepe paper arms. I want to welcome people to come sit and talk and be comforted. To perhaps spill some wise words. I never again want to give a fuck if someone finds me attractive. What a shallow way to think about men as well. (holiday eats) You can make all of these delicious Christmas/holiday foods anytime of year. Just sayin'. Pumpkin pie on the 4th of July. Christmas cookies for Easter. Cranberry sauce (as long as you freeze some berries) on a random day in May. There is no need to feel pressured to make green bean casserole or homemade rolls only in December. The realization that you can enjoy these things at any time of year takes some of the pressure off having to make all of the things at a time of year when your body may be craving rest. It allows you to nourish your body with what it is actually craving instead of stuffing it full of foods you believe only come once a year. (writing) Sitting down to a blank page is like going to work in your underwear. People may like what they see, or they’ll laugh or tell you where to buy a better fitting bra. When we write, especially when we share, we open ourselves to the harsh reality of standing in a room, exposed. (artist's statement) Kelli tells poetic stories that examine the connection between nature and human nature. Stories of love, rebirth, and longing. Stories of secrets hidden away in seashells and cottages of madness. Not content to limit herself, she rambles through themes and styles with the quiet voice of a conversation at midnight. She hopes her poems of solitude can give the reader a place to rest, away from the noise and chaos of the world. (aesthetic) I wish I could invite you into an aesthetic. We could sit in a white room on a blush couch free of crumbs and random letters. Drink sweet tea in matching cups, served on a wooden tray without stains of other lives. A perfectly neutral space where you could rest your feet on a plush pouf, instead of regrets. There would be order &amp; the perfect border of white space hiding closets full of autobiographies &amp; sharp knives. I could invite you into an aesthetic lie, but really, where’s the fun in that? (a happiness collection) I once bought a silly, realistic-looking, plastic rooster. I thought it would be funny to set it by the front door of our new house. As people visited, they obviously noticed the rooster. And thought that it meant I had a love of roosters. Pretty soon I was getting roosters for gifts. Rooster prints, rooster doorstops, ceramic roosters. Before I knew it I had a whole collection of roosters.\nThe problem was, it really wasn’t my thing. I didn’t have any great love for roosters. Sometimes life can be like that. It starts throwing things at you that you really don’t want. You find yourself spending your days doing things you don’t enjoy. Your life becomes a collection of things you didn’t choose. Don’t live a life with a bunch of roosters you don’t want. Clear out all of the things that don’t bring you joy and live a life that makes you happy. In 2023 let's choose to live.\nLet's choose fun over fear.\nLet's create for ourselves rather than for likes.\nLet's make terrible art.\nLet's laugh at stupid shit.\nLet's love and be open to others without the fear of rejection.\nLet's choose people who go out of their way to show us they care over the assholes who treat us like burdens.\nLet's make the world a better place.\nLet's promote what we love rather than giving space to what we hate.\nLet's look at each other with compassion.\nLet's be vulnerable.\nLet's be soft.\nLet's realize that each person is inherently worthy of our love.\nLet's realize that we are the people inherently worthy of love.\nLet's create a circle of acceptance.\nI love you all. I hope you carry that love and just a dash of hope into 2023.\nHappy New Year! (4 Am) - It's almost 4am.\n4am is the hour when we admit all of the feelings we have that we tell ourselves we shouldn't\nAll of the truths we swallow down when the sun is up and everything seems like it will work out\n4am tells us were fools to believe any of it\n4am makes us face ourselves in the darkness like Luke facing himself in that cave on Dagobah. We realize we are really Darth Vader even though we thought we were a Jedi at heart.\n4am is the hour of facing our dark side and realizing it's who we really are. 8/7/22 (fuck off) To the \"agree to disagree\" crowd\nI am respectful of your beliefs and your way of life until those beliefs impact others.Human rights are not up for debate.\nWhether they be reproductive rights, or Igbq rights, or equal rights for people of color or women, these things are not up for debate and I will not agree to disagree with you on any one of them.\nIf you try to shove your beliefs into my vagina and fuck me over with them, I will not \"agree to disagree.\"\nAnd don't come at me with your mask and vaccine mandate false equivalency arguments. My unplanned pregnancy does not affect you. Your covid breath affects me.\nJust so we're clear on this. (gendered sports) I have a solution for the people who are so pressed about trans women in sports. If it's a sport like swimming or running where people are timed, stop dividing people by gender and instead make time categories regardless of gender. Your average time in whatever race is however many seconds? You're in whatever category for that time. Gender doesn't have to come into it. Only speed.\nThere. I solved that problem. Stay tuned for more of my very wise solutions to invented problems. (on taking advice) Read all the booklists you want. Take all the suggestions, keep up to date on what's on the bestseller lists - but in the end, leave room for what you enjoy. If a book isn't speaking to you, no matter how well reviewed, how often suggested, then choose to put it down without finishing it. There are not enough years in a life to read all of the books and if you spend too many of them reading what's on other people's lists, you may never be able to compile your own.\nI would say a similar thing about any kind of list or advice. Read all of it you want, take what you need, but in the end you know yourself and what will work for you best. Reading a writer's list of what worked to get them writing may be a great place to start, but in the end only you know what works for you. Maybe they woke at dawn to write 100 pages before lunch. Maybe you sit down after lunch and write 20 pages. So, you decide to start waking at dawn, only you're not a morning person so you're falling asleep and not writing anything at all. Listen to your mind and body. It knows what works for you. Someone who has never even heard of you can't tell you how to work or play. (media consumption) How many corporate slogans, jingles, live rent free in your head? How much are you affected by the ads you see without even realizing? How much do we allow advertising and corporations to decide the things that bond is together as a society? TV shows we watch, movies we've seen, songs chosen for us to hear on the radio, jingles and ads that are the glue of generations. Products we all remember from the specific point in history that was our childhood shared with our cohorts. How much does this shape our collective experience? How are we united by things we never chose? How are we divided by them?\nHow much have I been altered by the media I consumed as a child/teenager? All the books, movies, TV shows, and love songs? How much of my dialogue was written in a script in the 80s? Are my expectations of relationships based in a scripted, unrealistic ideal?\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"media/thoughts.png","fullURL":"03-flowers/passing-thoughts.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["media/thoughts.html"],"createdTime":1702745610000,"modifiedTime":1755749143325,"sourceSize":8389,"sourcePath":"03 Flowers/Passing Thoughts.md","exportPath":"03-flowers/passing-thoughts.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":62,"backlinks":["03-flowers/03-flowers.html"],"type":"markdown"},"03-flowers/tiny-musings.html":{"title":"Tiny Musings","icon":"","description":"<img alt=\"musings.png\" src=\"media/musings.png\" target=\"_self\">\n📌 every day in this country there is another wound on our hearts\nundated I have never done any drug harder than alcohol, but I'm telling ya, when I'm an old woman I'm going to smoke a little weed and just not give a shit what other people are doing with their own damn lives.\nundated (sometime in 2024?) Don't let men steal your time from creating and writing and being and rising and reaching every bit of potential you have. Goddamn, I am so fucking intelligent. I am so fucking capable. Why did I give away my power so easily? (Thoughts while reading The Bell Jar)\nOctober 10, 2024 I drink coffee like it would kill me to remember your promises.\n2024 Genocide, war, equality, rights - these things get labeled \"political\" when they are literally the things that impact the very life of other people or ourselves. Politics is what decides if we live freely or under fascism. Whether we have health care or not. It decides if minorities are protected or lynched. Whether bombs are dropped on children or if we agree that all life is valuable. \"Politics\" is our voice against evil. Every human, no matter their profession or passion, has a right to that voice and should be free to use it as loudly as they are called to do.\nDecember 30, 2023 What if all the humans left the internet, except for bill paying and personal things? What if we let the AI generated content and all of the ads get likes and traffic from the porn bots. Let the algorithms feed themselves on machine made content only consumed by other machines? Would the internet continue on while humans read real books by real people and talked to each other again? We are headed to a place where AI is going to get so good at content creation and deepfakes that we are at risk of getting sucked into an attention dominating black hole, but where right now it's human made content pulling us in, soon it will all be machine made to cater to our very specific tastes. Machines entertaining us with machine made content while ads scroll by. Who are the people that really want that future?? The ones set to make the most money from it. At any cost.\nDecember 29, 2023 The Secret to Life:\npay attention\nlove what you love\nshare what you love\ncreate something\nshare that\nrepeat enthusiastically\nJuly 17, 2023 We are the latest of a people once new, who've forgotten most of what we once knew.\n&gt; July 16, 2023 Maybe, for whatever reason, unknown to you now, you were born a writer. You were born to string words together. And maybe, for some unknown reason, you are supposed to string those words together in obscurity. It’s your birthright. It has always felt like your birthright. Accept it. Hold it as you would any fragile gift, and use it without fear.\nUndated I want to lighten the world, to erase the creeping darkness. I want to create a space of beauty. A space that promotes what I love, rather than highlights what I hate. If we focused solely on what feeds our souls, could we not rid the world of what eats at them?\nFebruary 28, 2021 Names for my imaginary band:\npop: The Fuzzy Peppermints\nindie: Rustic Church\npunk: Graphic Blandishment\nall girl pop punk: Yeah Nadia Can a society that measures time by wars achieve peace?\nApril 1, 2017 Paying the bill at dinner last night: Husband: Do you have any ones?\nMe: Go fish.

Let a little more life into your days, so that when you are at the end of that life, you may draw upon the well of experience and drink from memory. You have the right to keep your secrets. To secretly dream, to secretly love, to secretly hate. They, and your body, are the only things you own outright. I feel like the older I get the more I want to live and speak authentically. I don't want to censor myself or be someone I'm not anymore. If a cat eats a moth, is it like when we eat a powdered donut? If only I could pursue my current goals with the tenacity of 12 year old me calling the radio station over and over for a solid week trying to win Huey Lewis and the News tickets. I am the only person on a planet of almost 8 billion who just saw a chipmunk taking a bath on my back patio. For all the terrible things happening all at once, there are also so many small astonishments out there if only we take the time to really look. Do not let age put out your fire. Do not silence yourself. Do not become cold. Do not become hard. Stay soft, stay curious, stay playful. Become fierce with the passing years. The world is full of people who have no idea how technology works. Who have no idea how to research basic information. They are electing other people like them who have no idea how anything works. And the rest of us are being held hostage by their ignorance and thirst for power. It's terrifying. Social Media has created a world where we strive to be right instead of kind. We share with strangers things we are too afraid to share with friends. We’re living in a sandcastle, pretending the tide will never come. It helps to remember that no one else knows what the fuck they are doing either. Mirror, mirror on the wall - you’re so focused on looks, you judgmental jerk. Society keeps you caged with the illusion of freedom. I feel like I'm at the age where I need to start asking myself just what kind of old lady I want to be. Have you ever been nurtured?\nReally.\nHave you? Reconnecting with people you haven't talked to since high school is like the awkward reunion episode of a long cancelled TV show. Most things exist between the extremes. What could be waiting for you to arrive? I wonder if clouds ever look down on us and say \"Hey, look! That one is shaped like\nan idiot.\" I sat for an hour in a quiet house of bird song and wind, mom mode off. Reading of injustice and the way hearts and minds reroute and heal from destruction. Outraged at the lack of empathic response in humans who house a brain wired for connection.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"media/musings.png","fullURL":"03-flowers/tiny-musings.html","pathToRoot":"..","attachments":["media/musings.html"],"createdTime":1704669630000,"modifiedTime":1755784588351,"sourceSize":7175,"sourcePath":"03 Flowers/Tiny Musings.md","exportPath":"03-flowers/tiny-musings.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":63,"backlinks":["03-flowers/03-flowers.html"],"type":"markdown"},"04-rabbit-holes/bibliophile/2011-reading-log.html":{"title":"2011 Reading Log","icon":"","description":"\nElizabeth Street - Fabiano, Laurie\nThe Happiness Project - Rubin, Gretchen\nPerfect on Paper: The (Mis)Adventures of Waverly Bryson - Murnane, Maria\nThe Devil in the White City - Larson, Erik\nBeware Dangerism!

I still ended up reading quite a few books this year and thought I’d do a top 10 list to round up my 2017 reading, in no particular order:\nDark Matter | Blake Crouch - An excellent novel about alternate realities.\nWhat Alice Forgot | Liane Moriarty - Alice can’t remember anything about her past, not even her husband and children. The Girl From the Well | Rin Chupeco - Based on a Japanese folktale, a very poetic “horror” novel (I didn’t find it that frightening) about a ghost who seeks revenge on people who murder children.\nReal Happiness | Sharon Salzberg - How to use meditation and mindfulness to live a happier life. Sharon Salzberg is one of my favorite Buddhist teachers.\nThe Humans | Matt Haig - An alien sent from an idyllic world to murder a professor who has just solved a mathematical problem that was supposed to remain unsolved. He takes the professor’s place and slowly begins to embrace what makes us human.\nThe Stranger in the Woods | Michael Finkel - Non-fiction about a hermit who lived undiscovered in the woods of Maine for 30 years and what happened to him once he was found.\nThe Ghost Writer | Philip Roth - Twisty, turny stories within a story about long-distance love, family secrets, and the things that haunt us.\nTurtles All the Way Down | John Green - A novel that shows us just how hard it can be to live in the world while suffering from OCD and trying to solve the mystery of a missing person.\nBefore I go to Sleep | S. J. Watson - I read this book in a day. Every night Christine goes to sleep and forgets everything that happened in the last 20 years. Until she starts keeping a journal of her days.\nZen in the Art of Writing | Ray Bradbury - I read a few Ray Bradbury books this year and enjoyed them all. This one really helped me reclaim my own voice in my writing.\nI’ve already got a stack of books ready to go for 2018. I hope to be better about sticking with a book next year, I abandon way too many books lately.One of my New Year's Resolutions was to read a book a week in 2017. It's the only resolution I've kept so far. 😊 This month I read:Writing Down the Bones•Natalie Goldberg - An excellent book to help break out of a writing rut and play with creativity. Written in short vignettes, it's not a \"how-to\" manual, but contains exercises and ideas to help put emotion into your writing, ways to challenge your writing.The Midnight Assassin•Skip Hollandsworth - The true story of a serial killer in Austin, Texas in 1885. The detail in this book makes you feel like you're in Austin in the 1800s. It not only details the early days of the city and the murders, but also shows how the investigation was hindered by the lack of technology and the racist beliefs of the time.And Then There Were None•Agatha Christie - I've read several books by Agatha Christie and enjoyed them all. This \"cozy\" mystery takes place on an island where the murderer has to be one of the characters investigating the murders. This one had me reading every moment I could spare just so I could find out who the murderer was.Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl•Carrie Brownstein - The autobiography of the Sleater-Kinney guitarist and one of the creators of the show \"Portlandia.\" I (falsely) believed that Sleater-Kinney was a Seattle band and hoped this book would talk a little about the music scene in Seattle in the 90s. They are actually from Olympia, Washington and other than touring with Pearl Jam, had very little to do with the Seattle scene. Still, I like Brownstein and this was a very interesting read about being in an all female punk band in the 90s. She seems very down to earth, a little lost and with a touch of anxiety. Several relatable passages here.Bonus book: The Outsiders•SE Hinton - I wanted my daughter to read this and she wasn't sure she would like it, so we read it together. Even teenagers benefit from reading aloud. I'm really glad we did, because this was one of my favorite books as a teen, but had forgotten quite a bit of the story. It was nice to share it with her.I started Captains and the Kings by Taylor Caldwell last night. It's 650 pages, so I may need to give myself 2 weeks!February BooksOne of my New Year's Resolutions is to read a book a week in 2017. I had planned to spend a couple of weeks reading “Captains and the Kings” which was recommended to me by my grandma. The story is very good, but it is so wordy! Taylor Caldwell spends entire paragraphs describing a mountain or a house. I’ve only made it a quarter of the way through because I get a little bored with it. I’m still working on it though. I had a few books come in that I’d had on hold at the library, so I did still end up reading a book per week. This month I read:Dark Matter•Blake Crouch - I devoured this book in a weekend. I was hooked from the very beginning. The plot involves a physics professor who gets kidnapped and discovers the existence of the multiverse. This book had me thinking for days about the choices we make and how cool it would be if new universes split off from every decision we made. Just a very cool novel!Harry Potter and the Cursed Child•JK Rowling, John Tiffany, Jack Thorne - I wasn’t sure I wanted to read this. First of all it’s a play and secondly, it wasn’t written entirely by JK Rowling, but it’s canon to the story, so I had to. I really enjoyed the story, it was nice to be back in the wizarding world (I read the books to my kids over a period of 2 years. I was sad when we ended the 7th book because it felt like we had been living at Hogwarts for so long!), and the feel was true to the books. I did have a problem with a few of the details (the workings of the polyjuice potion, Hermione didn’t protect that time tuner very well) and I really hated the way Ron was portrayed (he’s my favorite!), but all in all I enjoyed it and it was good to see that even Harry Potter has issues parenting! What Alice Forgot•Liane Moriarty - Another that I read in just a few days. I loved this book! The main character falls off of her bike at spin class and loses her memory of the last 10 years. She doesn’t even remember her children. I think part of the reason I liked the book so much was that I could really relate to Alice. I highlighted a ton of passages in the book. It also made me think about memories and the things that make our lives what they are. The nature of relationships and the way that shared experiences shape them.How Not to Die•Dr. Michael Gregor - Just your basic book about eating a plant based diet for living a healthier life. I’m already 99% vegan, so I didn’t need convincing about the benefits of plants. However, this book is filled with the science behind why some foods are better for us than others and it inspired me to clean up my eating. I had become a bit of a “junk food vegan.”I have been reading “Charlotte’s Web” with my son and “The Absolutely True story of a Part Time Indian” with my daughter. I’m hoping to finish both of those in the next week or so. I also have to get back to “Captains and the Kings.”April BooksOne of my New Year’s Resolutions was to read a book a week in 2017. In April I read:The Girl from the Well*Rin Chupeco - I really, really loved this “horror” novel. I’m not much into the horror genre (although I do enjoy a good zombie book), but this didn’t contain too much gore and it was really beautifully written. The story is based on an actual Japanese folk tale about Okiku, a spirit who haunts a well in Japan. In the book she leaves the well and avenges the deaths of children who have been murdered. Freeing their souls. She meets a teenage boy who is haunted by a dark spirit and they end up travelling to Japan as she tries to help him. The writing in this book is almost poetic and the imagery is wonderful. An excellent story that I enjoyed very much.The Little Book of Hygge*Meik Wiking - I don’t know why I wasted my time with this. I like the Danish idea of Hygge - basically creating a cozy atmosphere. This book really could have been summed up in a blog post. It’s repetitive and makes the whole thing seem very pretentious. Apparently you need hundred dollar lamps, organic vegetables and sheep skins to create hygge. It talked about leaving restaurants because they aren’t hygge enough. I don’t know, the whole thing just felt like taking a really simple thing and complicating it for the sake of writing a book. The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane*Kate DiCamillo - Technically, I read this book to my son over the course of the month, but it is such a beautifully written book that I wanted to include it here. The story really isn’t just for kids. A china rabbit named Edward Tulane finds himself on many adventures filled with heartbreak while he learns what it means to love and to be loved. This book made me cry. Really wonderful writing and such a lovely story.Why I Wake Early*Mary Oliver - I’m trying to read more poetry books and I have always wanted to read Mary Oliver. This is a very slim book that could probably be read in a day. I read it a few times, highlighting lines throughout. I can relate to Oliver’s love of nature and I like the simplicity of her words. There is deep meaning in that simplicity! I look forward to reading more poetry by Mary Oliver.\n…\nThis was another weird month of not reading as much as I would have liked. I’ve been having a hard time sticking to a book. I started and didn’t finish a couple of books this month. I really feel it’s still trying to get through The Captains and Kings that is keeping me from reading other things. I would have given up on this book long ago if I wasn’t reading it at my grandmother’s request. I’ve decided to read the chapters she specifically wanted me to read and then go back and try to finish the book a little at a time. I fall asleep every time I start reading it! June BooksLast month I complained that my New Year’s Resolution to read a book a week had put so much pressure on me, that I had gotten to the point where I wasn’t reading anything. So, I gave up the resolution and ended up reading more that usual in the month of June. So, even though I said I wasn’t going to do this, here’s a roundup of the books I read:Ready Player One|Ernest Cline - I had a whole stack of new books to read, but instead I started off the month by going back to a book I love. I have now read this book three times and I enjoy it just as much everytime. The book takes place in a dystopian future where everyone spends most of their days logged into the virtual world of the OASIS. I fear an actual VR like the OASIS will be developed because it really does sound awesome. The creator of the OASIS dies and leaves behind a kind of Easter Egg hunt to win his entire fortune. Since he had come of age in the 80s, people looking for the clues have to become experts in pop culture of the 80s. With all of its video game references and 80s pop culture references, this book is perfect for a geeky 80s kid like me. It’s just a really fun read.&nbsp;Dream Work|Mary Oliver - Another amazing collection by Mary Oliver. I just love her quiet insightfulness and deep appreciation for the lessons hidden in nature. I really love the poem “Wild Geese” which is included here. Also, “The Journey,” “Sunrise,” and “The Waves.” The whole book is wonderful, but those are my favorites. There’s much food for thought here. (Thank you for the recommendation, Marie!)Jesus’ Son|Denis Johnson - I first came across this book when @whiskeyandpens posted about it. Then when Johnson died last month, I read a few articles he had written for Salon. The one about homeschooling his son really hit home and echoed so many of my own views about the school system and why I homeschool. So, I decided I had to give this book of short stories a try. I have to say that I was really undecided about it until the end. It wasn’t really my thing, and the little vignettes about alcoholics and drugs seemed like they didn’t have much of a point. Yet, there were moments of sheer poetry sprinkled throughout the book and the last story really brought it all together for me. I may not ever read it again, but it was enjoyable.The Humans|Matt Haig - I somehow ended up following Matt Haig on Twitter even though I had never read any of his novels. He tweets a lot about suffering from depression and anxiety in a way I can really relate to. This book popped up on sale on Amazon for a couple of dollars, so I bought it. I really, really enjoyed it. Yes, it contains a lot of cliche observations about humans, but it was still beautifully written. The basic premise is that a mathematician on Earth studying prime numbers comes up with a formula that would change all of human existence. An alien race, itself living in a society based on geometry and prime numbers, decides humankind is not ready for this bombshell discovery and sends an alien to Earth to stop it. His job is to kill the mathematician, take his place as his clone to find out who else he told about the discovery and kill them. Instead he ends up finding a deep love and understanding for the humans and ultimately decides to stay on Earth. I just really loved the observations about the good things about humanity in this book. We face our own ugliness as a species everyday and it was nice to be reminded that there are good things about us.Queen of Hearts|Dipendra Tamang - Our own @thangbalay published a book of his poems and I had to buy it! The poems are all dedicated to “women and the strength of their being…” I really feel that this is some of Dipendra’s best work here. I especially enjoyed “Flawed,” “Her Three State,” “Be Like,” “LIghtning,” and “Water the Plants.” Thank you, Dip for a book of poetry that celebrates women.&nbsp;The Book of Whimsies|CS Hughes - Another poetry book by a member of the IG community, @cshughes. I am going to be honest here - I started this book once and then abandoned it. But, after reading his work on IG, I decided to try it again. I’m glad I did! This is just a really beautiful book of poetry. I don’t always understand what Hughes is talking about, but I love the sound of the way his words flow. The way they feel in my brain. I especially loved the “Billy Ruffian” poems, “Dragonfly Days,” “Dapple,” “Sirtaki,”&nbsp; and “A Poem For You and The End Of Time.” I hope to read his other books available on Amazon.Real Happiness|Sharon Salzberg - It’s no secret to anyone who’s followed me for awhile that I suffer from anxiety. A lot of it is social anxiety. Did I say the wrong thing? Did I do something stupid? Did I make a mistake and not realize? Am I bothering people with my presence? It’s also everyday stuff. Did I turn off the coffee pot? Is the door locked? Did I pay that bill? Driving just about makes me want to jump out of my skin. Not wanting to go on medication, I try to get some exercise, sunshine, and vitamin B everyday. That all helps somewhat. But what really helps? 20 minutes of meditation every day. I can’t explain it, but it really, really helps. It helps me examine the ways I let myself get carried away in my head and allows me to stop the spiraling thoughts. This book is 28 days of meditation and mindfulness practice to build concentration, awareness of our bodies and thoughts and lovingkindness. The lovingkindness meditations really help because I tend to be really hard on myself. I love, love Sharon Salzberg. She is really down to earth and relatable. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to start a meditation practice and maybe find a little extra calm in your life.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"January Books","level":2,"id":"January_Books_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"04-rabbit-holes/bibliophile/2017-reading-log.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1703196053000,"modifiedTime":1755748300913,"sourceSize":16195,"sourcePath":"04 Rabbit Holes/Bibliophile/2017 Reading Log.md","exportPath":"04-rabbit-holes/bibliophile/2017-reading-log.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":68,"backlinks":["04-rabbit-holes/04-rabbit-holes.html"],"type":"markdown"},"04-rabbit-holes/bibliophile/2018-reading-log.html":{"title":"2018 Reading Log","icon":"","description":"January:\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Vargas-Between Breaths\" data-href=\"Vargas-Between Breaths\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Between Breaths</a> - Elizabeth Vargas (memoir)\n‎The Fault in our Stars - John Green\n‎Umbrella Academy - Gerard Way (graphic novel)\n<br>‎<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Hirshfield-The Heart of Haiku\" data-href=\"Hirshfield-The Heart of Haiku\" href=\".html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">The Heart of Haiku</a> - Jane Hirshfield (Kindle single)\n‎The Red Tent - Anita Diamant\n‎Hard Times Require Furious Dancing - Alice Walker (poetry collection)\nFebruary:\n7.

WhiteJanuary 2018A really good beginning to a year of reading! In January I read:\n.\nBetween Breaths - Elizabeth Vargas - A memoir of anxiety and addiction. It was ok. It felt very rushed like too much was crammed into it.\n.\n‎The Fault in our Stars - John Green - YA novel about a romance between two teens with cancer. I devoured it. Very well written tear-jerker.\n.\n‎Umbrella Academy - Gerard Way (graphic novel) - I'm not one for comic books usually, but was curious about this because of the upcoming Netflix series. It was dark and weird and I can't decide if I want to read the next one or not. I didn't hate it.\n.\n‎The Heart of Haiku - Jane Hirshfield (Kindle single) - A short book about the haiku master Basho. A lovely read including many of his haiku.\n.\n‎The Red Tent - Anita Diamant - I read this 20 years ago and had completely forgotten what happened in it. A biblical story, but not a religious story. Speaks to the power and strength of women. Now one of my top 3 books.\n.\n‎Hard Times Require Furious Dancing - Alice Walker - A quiet, thoughtful collection of poetry. I will definitely return to these again and again.\n...\nI also started: @aluxaard 's novel/poetry/memoir, \"The Alux Chronicles.\" Very good so far! Sharon Salzberg's \"Real Love\" about metta meditation and learning to love with an open heart. \"Presto!\" by Penn Jillette about how he lost 100 pounds. Very entertaining! Finally, \"If You Want to Write\" by Barbara Ueland. Not my favorite book on writing so far. Yes. I'm always reading multiple books at once. It's been a lifelong thing. February 2018February book roundup: Presto!: How I Made Over 100 Pounds Disappear and Other Magical Tales - Penn Jillette - I really enjoyed Penn’s writing, even if he is a bit of a name dropper. This book is about much more than just how he lost 100 pounds after having a heart attack and being told he should have weight reduction surgery. The diet he used is quite extreme and maybe a little crazy. An enjoyable read even if you don’t need to lose weight! How to Stop Time - Matt Haig - I really loved this book about a man who ages very slowly and has lived hundreds of years. It’s a bit far fetched that he ran into several well known people in those years, but the encounters fit the story well. It captured my interest and by the end I wondered how it would all come together with just 30 pages to go. I’ve read a couple of other Haig books and they’re not intellectual, literary reads. They’re feel good books that offer palatable insights into life. Haig has been very open about how writing saved him from a dark, suicidal place. His books are easy, uplifting and fun and sometimes we all need that. Tattoos and Time - Wren Kay - Beautiful collection of poetry focusing on nature and sensuality from our own @wrenpoetess. I really loved the feel of these quiet poems and will definitely reread it again and again! Romeo and Juliet - William Shakespeare - I assigned this to my daughter for school, so read it with her. I read it as a freshman in high school and don’t remember it being so racy. I surprised myself at how well I could understand the flowery language. Alux Chronicles - Michael Sanders - I started this one last month and finished this week. I have been a fan of @aluxaards poetry since I started on Instagram and really enjoyed this poetry collection/memoir. So much so that I’m going to order a hard copy after reading it as an ebook. This isn’t just a poetry collection. Michael bares his soul and bravely shows us moments of his life. The book shows the evolution of his poetry and his growth as a person. I highly recommend it! I’m still reading “Real Love” by Sharon Salzberg. I’m taking that one slowly because there is a lot of work to do there. I also started reading “Theft by Finding” the diaries of writer David Sedaris. I love it! He is so human and hilarious!\fMarch 2018March Book Roundup: Theft By Finding - David Sedaris - I really enjoyed this collection of diary entries from 1977 - 2002. Knowing how much success he’s had as an author, it’s interesting to look back on his days of being poor, writing at his local IHOP, doing construction work, and his heavy drinking and drug use. The book was funny and insightful and made me think differently about the way I keep a journal. Sedaris doesn’t just write about his day to day life, but collects little bits of dialogue and scenes he observes. I’ve been trying to do more of that in my own journal. Animal Farm - George Orwell - I assigned this book to my daughter for school, so I reread it as well. Definitely a classic that lives up to the hype. Well written and eye opening. I realize it’s supposed to be about the dangers of communism, but I could see a lot of parallels to our current political atmosphere. The gaslighting the pigs use on the other animals is something we’re seeing everyday from the White House. The Death of Roger Ackroyd - Agatha Christie - It’s been a stressful, crazy couple of months in our house, and my brain needed a break. I tend to buy these Agatha Christie e-books when they’re on sale for $2 so I can turn to them when I just want to cozy in with some brain candy. This one wasn’t as good as the others I’ve read. “And Then There Were None” is a wonderful book! This one was ok and the ending was a bit of a surprise! Me Talk Pretty One Day - David Sedaris - After reading his diaries, I wanted to read an actual Sedaris book. I realized I’ve had this one on my bookshelf for years! Funny little essays about the author’s life. Very entertaining and funny. I actually did laugh out loud a few times at his struggle to learn French. I’m a little late with this, but my whole household has been suffering from colds and flu. Headaches, fevers, body aches, coughing, runny noses. I’m looking forward to warm weather so we can all get out and make some Vitamin D!\nApril 2018Book Roundup: White Noise - Don DeLillo - I love DeLillo’s casual observations about life - the almost poetic, philosophical moments of reflection on human nature. I enjoyed the first half of the book, but by the end I became a little more unsure about the story. I really can’t say why, but he just kind of lost me. It is an unusual story and it made me think. I would still recommend it. The Fact of the Body - Alexandria Marzano-Leznovich - This was a very disturbing read based on the true story of the murder of a little boy in the early 90s combined with the author’s own experience of being abused as a child. It was a hard book to read, infuriating in the way the author wasn’t protected by her own parents, but well researched and well written. What Unites Us - Dan Rather - I’ll admit I’m a fan of Dan Rather probably because of his “liberal bias.” He lays out what he feels are the challenges facing the United States today and, calling on many historical moments, suggests what we need to do to fix things. I enjoyed the history lessons of the book, and while he does seem to gush about the past, he also balances it with the things that we haven’t always gotten right. I don’t think it left me with the optimism he was hoping for. It instead made me realize that the more things seem to change, the more they just really stay the same. I didn’t do as much reading last month as I would have liked, but it was a tough month. I also can’t share a snazzy picture of my stack of books because I only read ebooks. It’s so convenient to borrow them from the library and have them delivered right to my Kindle. I really do enjoy the ritual of an actual book, but sometimes life calls for the convenience of an ebook. In addition to the books I finished, I also started reading “The Wind-Up Girl,” but could not get into and gave up on. I started a book I’m really enjoying called “The Abundance of Less “ about people in Japan who give up the rat race for a quiet life in the mountains. And I’m halfway through reading “Brave New World” which I assigned my daughter for school and we’re reading together. May 2018May Book Roundup I'll Be Gone In the Dark/Michelle McNamara - There is a lot of information packed into this true story of the Golden State Killer. McNamara researched every possible lead and I can imagine how the details weighted on her. The story of the victims and the pursuit by law enforcement is told in a very narrative style that drew me in completely. I wish she could have survived to see the killer caught and to have continued her pursuit of the real stories of other unsolved crimes. I highly recommend this book. Big Magic/Elizabeth Gilbert - I almost gave up on this one after the first chapter. When Gilbert starts talking about ideas floating around in the ether, landing in artist’s brains, and floating on to someone else if they don’t get used - I was ready to stop reading. But, I stuck with this book about writing and creativity and I ended up getting a lot of really good inspiration out of it in the end. The advice about not writing as a career, but as a joy and a passion was something I needed to hear. Skip this one if you’re already in a good place with your art. Brave New World/Aldous Huxley - Very mixed feelings. I know it’s a classic, but it’s not my favorite dystopian future novel. It seemed a bit all over the place. A very interesting set up that didn’t seem to really go anywhere. I did enjoy the message that there isn’t anything wrong with not going along with the crowd - the most interesting people never do! I found “1984” a much more interesting story as far as classic dystopian novels. Show Your Work/Austin Kleon - This is a very quick read on how to get your work out to the world in some very non-traditional ways. Kleon includes many, many quotes from other artists on sharing your work. Worth a read if you need ideas of getting your art out there. Swan/Mary Oliver - Love, love, love Oliver and I really enjoyed the poems in this very slim book. She just knows how to mix nature and the human spirit and she really speaks to me. Well worth reading!\n…\nJune has not gotten off to a great start as far as reading. I’ve been focused on prose writing for the past few weeks, not on reading or writing poetry. Hence, the lack of posts. June 2018June Book Roundup Felicity/Mary Oliver - I love Mary, but this wasn’t my favorite collection of hers. There were some excellent poems, but overall it was a very short collection without anything that really pulled me in. Still, even here, she writes more beautifully than I can ever hope to. Buddhism and Zen/Nyogen Senzaki - I’m used to westernized, pop psychology Buddhism written in plain language. This was the real thing from the 40s by a zen monk from Japan. While I feel that I got the roots of what the book was saying, I was lost most of the time. I had it from the library so I hurried through. Perhaps the concepts would sink in more if I had more time with them. The Rain in Portugal/Billy Collins - This was the first time I had read a collection of poetry by Billy Collins and I really enjoyed it. I like the everyday feel of what he writes about. I like the seemingly plain language that hides something deeper. I will definitely be reading more from him! Reasons to Stay Alive/Matt Haig - This is part memoir of the author’s struggle with his mental health and part a primer on depression and anxiety. It was his story and the story of millions of others. I suffer from the anxiety end and could relate to much of what he experienced. This is an excellent book for anyone who is suffering from depression and anxiety or wants a better understanding of what that experience is like. An Abundance of Less/Andy Couturier - Set in Japan about people who leave the rat race of Tokyo for a life in the mountains. Many are artists and activists who protest the impact of nuclear power and urbanization. While I may not be ready to move off the grid and grow my own food, I found this book inspiring. They have chosen their own path in a country that rewards uniformity. They’re living their truth with very little material wealth. I felt like the book was almost a meditation on a simpler way of life.\n…\nI hadn’t let myself start anything new until I finished up everything I was already reading. I’m going to try to limit myself to 2 books at a time. We’ll see how long that lasts. I’m now reading “Bird by Bird” by Anne Lamott and “The Soloist” by Mark Salzman.

I made my own websites at first, journaled on various forums, had a LiveJournal, many Wordpress blogs, and have used various social medias as a type of diary. None of these ways of capturing my thoughts for public consumption quite fit the bill of how I wanted to express myself online. While I really enjoyed the community feel of forums and social media, there was always a pressure to respond and read everyone else before posting my own words. Having a blog felt too formal. Like everything had to be just right before I could put it out to the world. Polished, with the right photo, tags, categories, date created. After hitting \"post\" it was \"out there,\" never to be touched or updated again. I'm a bit obsessive when it comes to these things and once the thing was out there with a published date, I would feel like I couldn't go back to it and change it. Where would it fit? With the old date or a new one?<br>I have been using <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://obsidian.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://obsidian.md\" target=\"_self\">Obsidian</a> for note taking for quite awhile now, and enjoy the flexibility of undated, living, evolving notes and writings. When books had to written out by hand by monks, when pamphlets had to be printed at the printing press, when the only way to look up a fact was in the encyclopedia, perhaps it made sense to think of things as needing to be polished and finished before the expense was put forward to make a hard copy of a story, fact, or essay. But, we live in the age of digital ink, for the lay person who is keeping a blog or finding a way to publish their ideas, there is no reason for a polished final product.<br>As I have become jaded on the idea of keeping a formal blog, I still want to have an informal online presence. As I went down the rabbit hole of options, I came across the idea of a \"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history/\" target=\"_self\">digital garden</a>.\" A place to <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Learning+in+public\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Learning+in+public\" target=\"_self\">learn in public</a>, explore half formed ideas, and link one thought to another through building a \"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.ssp.sh/brain/second-brain\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www.ssp.sh/brain/second-brain\" target=\"_self\">second brain</a>.\"<br>I have been using <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://obsidian.md\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://obsidian.md\" target=\"_self\">Obsidian</a> for note taking for about a year and it was the idea of linking notes and keeping \"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes?stackedNotes=zKGjQtsTKgscAoq271ZzKqw\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes?stackedNotes=zKGjQtsTKgscAoq271ZzKqw\" target=\"_self\">evergreen</a>\" notes that lead me to start a garden of my own.A reverse chronologically organized space with set dates implying that these things were finished, never to be returned to and updated, wasn't working for my curiosity driven, ever changing brain. Feeling the need to have every thought fleshed out and finished before sharing made me just not write at all. Feeling like the space needed to be polished in a perfect SEO driven format with perfectly aesthetic and glossy photos wasn't my style either. I enjoyed playing. Playing with graphics and fonts and layouts, but that took away from the actual writing. I also didn't want to be a \"content creator.\" I want to be a real person putting real thoughts on a page to connect with other real people out there.Welcome to the garden!

Very different women who are both leaving something behind. They take turns telling their stories to each other as the train carries them further from their pasts.The Leaving Women started as a single poem and grew into an idea as I wrote more poems in a series. I have always liked the idea of telling a story through a series of poems. No dialogue, no plot devices, no world building. Just a series of poems that connect like a story. Like a concept album, a rock opera in poetry.In The Leaving Women, we have two women who meet on a train, the rebellious Shelley and quiet Leigha. They are both leaving lives and lovers behind to head for something unknown. They find a kindred spirit in each other and as the train carries them away from their pasts, they share their stories.Shelley gets her name from the famed poet Percy Shelley, who has always held a special place in my heart. Leigha is named after his good friend Leigh Hunt, also a poet, but one who enjoyed much less fame than Percy. Much like the balance between the two women in our tale. I won’t say much more about them because I want you to meet them for yourself.Quote\nI will no longer apologize for my fire.\nI will no longer cower before my own anger.\nI will own the spark that rises up\nlike a shield against your condescension,\nYou shoot arrows and expect me\nto accept the bleeding wounds&nbsp;\nthat come with your precision. ~ from the poem, For Too Long We’ve Been the Peacemakers\nQuote\nI was never very good at taking\npictures of the moon,\nbut this night the focus was crystal clear.\n“I don’t know if I like you or\nif you just taste like a memory,”\nI told him through the ruffled feathers\nof my second hand boa,\non a night when the milky way loomed\nlarge across his freckled face. ~ from the poem, A Day and a Night on Purgatory Road\nQuote\nI made a man
