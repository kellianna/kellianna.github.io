I don’t remember taking a step into a swirling vortex and riding it til it dumped me unceremoniously into an unknown life. I only remember the offer. That a man appeared as I was shoveling the snow for the tenth time that winter. That he seemed to appear out of the snowfall itself. Materializing as a swirl of flakes in a white down coat and jeans. Blue winter hat and shaggy surfer hair.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He smiled and asked me if it was time. From his pocket he pulled a smooth stone and held it out to me in his mittened hand. I looked at his kind eyes, his open smile, the red of his cheeks from the cold. I felt relieved to find a sign of life in the swirling snow, the cold, and the silence of a February morning.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He asked me why I was shoveling when it was still snowing. I said I wanted to get on top of it. Not have so much to shovel later. Besides, my afternoon was free and I had little other to occupy me. He asked if I would like to change that and he nodded toward the stone. A small, smooth stone of a pinkish hue. Swirls of burgundy brown.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The stone that would abandon me for periods of time and then return like long lost heirloom. The stone that ruled every decision I had made since I was seventeen. Sometimes I would be away from it long enough to forget that it was waiting for me. On this particular afternoon I had been without it for over two years. Its memory had faded like the colors of summer were now lost to the white day. I had thought this time I was free from its influence.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I suddenly remembered that he’d spoken, asked me if it was time, asked me if I’d like a change. I took a minute and thought about the last year. The last disastrous year, and I nodded.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The kind smile grew wider and he held it our further from his chest. “I thought so,” he said. “Go ahead, take it. I’ve been taking care of it, but really it has always been your keystone.”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I reached out my own gloved hand, realized that I needed to feel the smooth, cold outside of the stone for myself, and removed my glove. I again reached tentatively toward the stone. As my cold fingers came closer, I felt its heat radiating like tiny tendrils reaching to envelop my fingers and I felt a familiarity. I felt a homecoming in my fingers. I touched the stone tentatively and the air started to hum.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Remember,” said the man, “wherever you land, that’s where you were always meant to be.”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In a swirl of snowflakes the neighborhood and the man and my snow shovel disappeared and I was being swirled into the very air that created every flake of snow, every drop of rain. I was swirled into a snow tunnel of glittering, majestic, choice. And I took a left.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">And now I’m here. Lying on my back in a field of wildflowers. My hand clutching the stone. Looking up into the face of the man in the mittens, only he’s wearing a t-shirt and the sun is playing against his shaggy hair.</p></div><div class="el-h2"><h2 data-heading="Chapter One - Wildflowers" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Chapter_One_-_Wildflowers_0"><span class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></span>Chapter One - Wildflowers</h2></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He grins at me, reaches down and takes the stone from my hand, tosses it in the air, catches it in his fist, and begins walking away through the field of flowers.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Wait!” I call. “Where am I?”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">His pace doesn’t slow as he grins over his shoulder “Right where you are supposed to be,” he calls back to me, then disappears into an arch made from the limbs of dense trees in what I take to be the entrance of a forest.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I look around. Perfectly puzzled. Thoroughly perplexed. I was shoveling snow on a cold, windy, grey day and now, I am lying in a field of blooming wildflowers, with the sun beating like mid summer. Bees are buzzing, leaves are providing an orchestra to the day.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I look down and I am dressed in lightweight flowered shorts and a white t-shirt. Old, battered sneakers on my otherwise bare feet. The man’s words echo back to me, “Right where you are supposed to be” and yet, no where I have ever been before</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The trip is always disorienting. For a time after the stone leaves my hand I always feel a bit like I am a newborn. Nothing makes sense, my legs are uncertain under me, and the memory of what came before is like a fuzzy dream. There is never time to think about the decision to leave. Only time to remember that there was a reason I made that choice.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I stand up and take a look around. I thought I must have been miles from nothing, but I see there is a town up ahead and a house not far from the field I have landed in. There are cars and buildings like the ones I have left behind, so the change won’t be too disorienting. I haven’t landed at the feet of a knight drawing his sword or in the space age emptiness of an alien world. Just another reality like so many I’ve left before. I take a tentative step wondering if this will be a day trip or if I will be here for years like the home where my snow shovel is now being used by a woman who looks just like me, but isn’t exactly me.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I seem to smell saltwater on the summer breeze and I feel a great relief that I must have landed near the ocean. There have been places with no water and they have made me yearn to always live near the sea. Just as I’m pondering this, a man walks out the door of the nearby house, looks around, notices me and waves me over with his arm.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Come on! We’re going to be late! Unless you want to walk to the store, come on!”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Another stroke of luck. Byron is in this reality. I always miss him in the places he was never born. He needs a haircut and his t-shirt looks like it would be better off in the landfill, but it is good to see him. It’s been a few realities since I could rely on my older brother.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Why are you roaming around in the wildflowers when we need to be getting to work?”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Ummm, it’s just such a beautiful day and I feel like I haven’t seen the flowers in so long. After such a long winter."</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Did you hit your head on something while you were rolling around in the flowers? Winter’s been over for months, Shell. Now get in the car!”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He seems a bit frustrated with me, but then Byron is often frustrated with me when he happens to end up in my life. As much as there is always love between us, there is also&nbsp; his need to take care of everything and my need to fight him every step if the way.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I get in the car and turn to him with a grin, “It is so good to see you. I can’t tell you how relieved I am you’re here.”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Ok, now I know you hit your head in that field.” But, he returns my smile as he turns the key and a Foo fighters song from many a timeline starts playing on the car radio. Sometimes the jump is just right.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“If you want me to pick you up for work, I don’t mind, it’s on the way, but could you be ready to go next time instead of communing with nature?”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Sure. Yes. Sorry,” I manage to stammer. “I just feel a little out of sorts today.”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“It’s understandable with all that’s been going on. But, it’s going to work out, really. We’re going to figure out how to keep the store and how to continue to pay everyone and it will work out somehow. This was our dream. We won’t let it fail.”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I wish I had some idea of what he is talking about. I look out the window at the town passing by. Not tiny, but certainly not a metropolis. Clean, well maintained store fronts. People passing on their way to wherever it is people go at whatever time of day it is. It was late morning when I touched the Keystone. I glance around the dashboard looking for a clock and see that it’s 11:30 am. So, not much time has passed since my toes were freezing in the fresh snowfall. I wonder what date it is, but figure I really should try to play it some kind of cool before Byron decides he needs to worry about me.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I try to muster up a response to his cryptic words about a store. “Yes, I guess I have been more worried about it than I realized. I know we’ll figure it out. It’s just been a lot to think about.”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">“Of course it has. Not only the threat of losing the store, but you having to travel back and forth to New York to meet with a publisher that is making demands that seem very unreasonable for a first time author and they way you have been splitting yourself in two for months. Keeping the store going, writing, traveling. It’s too much. I keep telling you it’s too much.”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Too much. Just my luck to have fallen into another existence that is too much. I was shoveling snow in the middle of a snowstorm because I had suddenly found myself with too much time to think and too many reasons to want to get out of my head and into my body in the middle of a freezing February day. If I was going to find myself thrown into a life right in the middle of it, couldn’t I have chosen one that wasn’t too much?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I didn’t know how to reply so I just watched the town slip by, listened to the radio, and tried to figure out how I was going to once again pretend to be someone I had never met before.</p></div><div class="el-h2"><h2 data-heading="Interlude One - The Guardian" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Interlude_One_-_The_Guardian_0"><span class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></span>Interlude One - The Guardian</h2></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">It was always hard for him to leave her dropped right into the middle of a new life. No matter how many times he presented the stone and she took it, he felt like he was abandoning her over and over. In the beginning, when he was the new guy and she was still a teenager, he had begged to be able to explain to her what was happening. Why couldn’t she know? Why couldn’t he just tell her that it was her fate?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But the answer was always no. The answer was always that this is how it has always been done. The answer was always that she must choose a life of her own. The time would come for explanations, but not today. Not at the beginning. Not right after the choice had been made by the stone.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He would disappear into the woods or a crowd or into thin air if there was no other choice. He had learned not to look back. He had cultivated a joviality in these moments that hid his ache in not being able to run back and explain everything. The ache that no matter how many times they went through this, no matter how much he knew of her heart, she didn’t know him at all.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He was a ghost in a snowstorm, a smile on a crowded street, an apparition on a foggy beach, a familiar stranger again and again. A constant in her life, but a constant that only appeared when things went wrong.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">He had practiced exactly what he would tell her when the time came that he could explain it all. When they let him tell her how she was chosen as a child of air. When they had summoned him this time he thought it was for the purpose of explaining everything. After all, she had been in that place for so much longer than any other. But, as soon as he saw the snowy street, her slumped shoulders, and the grey of the sky in her eyes, he knew that it was just another opportunity for the stone to take center stage. It still wasn’t his time to tell her everything.</p></div><div class="el-h2"><h2 data-heading="Chapter Three -" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Chapter_Three_-_0"><span class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></span>Chapter Three -&nbsp;</h2></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The store turns out to be a bookstore on a quiet street leading to water in the distance.

They live on separate coasts and have other jobs to supplement the meager income of their book sales. She lives in New England and runs a bookstore. He lives in California and does web support for his brother’s company. They meet in NY at their editor’s office. She is a huge fan of his book and sees him as the perfect man. He has not yet read her poetry collections, but he does after meeting her and gets the feeling they are very much alike. They go out to dinner that first meeting and stay in touch a bit long distance. A big book convention is coming up and their editor/publisher thinks they should both attend to get fans excited for their next books. Which they are both struggling to write. The end up spending 3 days together in an airbnb because the publisher thinks their books compliment each other and wants to keep them as a sort of “team” throughout the convention and thinks they should know each other better to do that. They do end up closer and finding that they feel a lot of the same things about the nature of life and maybe each other. Then they have to go back to their lives apart. And she has to decide what to do about the secret she hasn’t revealed to anyone.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">She isn’t sure how she got to this existence. She doesn’t know how she was shoveling snow on a sidewalk one day when a man appeared out of the swirling snow and handed her a stone that seemed like something she had lost although she had never seen it before. As soon as the stone touched her hand she became part of the snowstorm and opened her eyes into a sunny day in a wildflower field with the man walking away into the woods calling out that he hoped this one would stick. A man who claimed to be her brother called to her from a house and suddenly she was riding in a car to the book store they owned together and was living a life she was just dropped into the middle of. She wrote poetry to deal with all of the secrets she couldn’t tell anyone. How did she get here? When her collection was published, the man showed up again one night as she was closing the bookstore. In the hush of the books and the coffee smell and the night at the window, he told her her own story.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That she had been here long enough now to choose. Stay or go. The stone he handed her was the key to her destiny. Every time she became uncertain about the timeline she was in, he showed up and handed her the stone. If it was time to move on, she was transported to another timeline. Another of the many multiverse that held another existence. She had been in the last one for many years, which is why she had forgotten about the stone. The longer she stayed somewhere, the more the memory of escape faded. But she and the stone were linked by history and he was her guardian through timelines. When it became obvious she was not in the right timeline, he always showed up and the stone always knew. After two years, he would show up like he had tonight and ask her if it was time. If she chose to stay, the memory of how she got here would fade. If she chose to go, no one would know as the her of this timeline would resume her place. How many times had this happened? She wanted to know. How many times have we had this conversation? What about my real parents? My real family? My real timeline? She demanded. How much history had he stolen to drag her through existences?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">As he had many times before, he gently explained. She was a child of air. She was born into an existence of smoke. She was fated to find the timeline she could do the most good. Like her ancestors before her, the only family that mattered was the one she chose. Yes, she had left behind other parents, other siblings, even a child here and there, but they didn’t know. They weren’t harmed by her choice to go. And it was always her choice. Whether it felt like it or not. She had been fated by the muses to move through the barrier of existence until she found the one where she could inspire, uplift, and create. In other timelines she had been a lawyer, a politician, a cult leader, a musician. A daughter, a sister, a mother. An olympic gold medalist. And in each of them, she had done some good. Some of them didn’t last 2 years. In some she knew sooner that it was time. In others, she knew it was time, but she was hesitant to go. In the last timeline, she had been an activist with a large family and a husband and child. he had come to her at the two year point and she had told him that she believed this was the one. This was where she could do the most good. He had taken the stone and believed that would be the last time he saw her. That he would now be the guardian of another child of air. Oh, yes. There were others. Her true sisters and brothers. But, then her husband had had an affair and in her despair, she had stopped being active in trying to change her community. The day she had been out shoveling snow, she had just taken a job as a cashier in a grocery store to pay the bills. Her child had just told her that she wanted to live with her dad and his new girlfriend. And life had taken one of those turns that life sometimes takes. That lets us know we are not on the right path. Most humans either decide to make a major change and maybe turn things around or they settle into the despair and disappear into themselves.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But she, as a child of air, as one chosen to do all they can to make change, she had another choice. And that morning in the swirling snow, she had made it without even realizing it. The stone had let him know and there he was again. On another street, in another town, handing her the same choice. And the part of her that remembered her purpose had taken it. And here she was. And now was the time to choose again. Stay or go.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">She couldn’t see why, if these were the rules, she would be given the option to stay in this timeline. All she was doing was running a bookstore that was barely solvent, writing poems, and falling hard for a guy who lived on the other side of the country. How was she changing the world? She posed this question to the man across the table. The guardian who had known her forever, but who she didn’t remember at all. Why this timeline? Why this existence? She had been an activist, a civil rights lawyer, a politician. Here she was just a lovesick poet. How could that change the world?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But, haven’t you learned, that love and words are the only things that ever have changed the world? That they are the only thing that really matters?</p></div><div class="footer"><div class="data-bar"></div></div></div></div></div><div id="right-content" class="leaf" style="--sidebar-width: var(--sidebar-width-right);"><div id="right-sidebar" class="sidebar"><div class="sidebar-handle"></div><div class="sidebar-topbar"><div class="topbar-content"><label class="theme-toggle-container" for="theme-toggle-input" id=""><input class="theme-toggle-input" type="checkbox" id="theme-toggle-input"><div class="toggle-background"></div></label></div><div class="clickable-icon sidebar-collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="3" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon"><path d="M21 3H3C1.89543 3 1 3.89543 1 5V19C1 20.1046 1.89543 21 3 21H21C22.1046 21 23 20.1046 23 19V5C23 3.89543 22.1046 3 21 3Z"></path><path d="M10 4V20"></path><path d="M4 7H7"></path><path d="M4 10H7"></path><path d="M4 13H7"></path></svg></div></div><div class="sidebar-content-wrapper"><div id="right-sidebar-content" class="leaf-content"><div class="graph-view-wrapper"><div class="feature-header"><div class="feature-title">Interactive Graph</div></div><div class="graph-view-placeholder">
