This won't wow you or keep you up at night or even be something you'll tell a friend about later. It's just a beginning. It's just a scene that will lead nowhere except to a place in your heart where you store your longing. A place that writes vignettes of another reality. That's all this is. A vignette of another reality that you write at night right before you fall asleep, the kind you won't even remember in the morning.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">This is what I tell myself when I sit down to write, so the pressure isn't too much. So that I can just pour out a story and not worry if anyone will care. It's just a nothing thing. An everyday thing. Which is how a lot of really meaningful things start. At least that's what I tell myself to convince myself it's not all a waste of time.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">But it's really all a waste of time, right? You live, you die, and the time in between will never really matter. Some would say it might matter a little more to those who actually change the times they're living in. Some would say that good people like Martin Luther King Jr and bad people like Hitler had changed the times they were living in and so maybe their time wasn't wasted. I say maybe Hitler needed a good hobby to distract him. And that MLK would be disappointed by how little has actually changed.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Now I'm not just wasting time, but words since I haven't even begun to tell you a story. A story you could call mine, but I can't prove that any of it really happened this way, or that it really happened at all. Sometimes those other realities blur and I can't tell one from another.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In this reality, I'm a writer. I already told you that. A writer with zero faith in her writing, which is probably why no one has ever read it. Actually, the members of my writing group have read me. And a few people I know online who write. But to the world at large I am insignificant, as I'm guessing you are as well. We are destined to die in obscurity. Which can either be freeing or depressing depending on your outlook. I choose to see it as freeing, as I have seen first hand the double edged sword of fame. My father wrote a bestseller and became something of a household name in the 1980s when people still read hardcovers and authors would appear on talk shows. It helped that he looked like a rock star and had never married my mother. The women swooned for his long hair and novels of life on tour as a roadie. Something he liked to tell people he had actually done.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's what I mean about the blurring of realities. At one time I thought my father was lying to sell more books, until I realized some part of him had come to believe that he had actually carried tour gear for Kiss in the 70s. And that he had slept with Paul Stanley's discarded groupies. If you ever read one of his novels, remember they're fiction. The only tour my father ever took was a book tour and the only thing he ever carried was the weight of a dream so heavy he had to set it down someplace. It fit perfectly on 8x11 typewriter paper, and even better in between two covers.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I won't lie. I inherited his penchant for fabrication. His belief in the realities that only existed in his mind. I came to believe I was something special by association. That I had lived those book tours and waited behind the curtains at talk shows for my father to introduce the world to his daughter.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">In reality I was at home with my mother, reading about girls who fit in and had boyfriends named Kevin who saved them from some supernatural bad guy.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Listening to my mother on the phone with another woman in another state who had just learned that my father had a daughter. Did my mother know that my father also had a son about a year older than me? Her face said she didn't, but she used her polite stranger voice and set up a meeting with the woman and my half brother. My life would never be the same.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">My brother Dave was everything I wasn't. Confident, loud, bratty, and hilarious. He couldn't care less that our dad only visited him twice a year, while I constantly sent my dad the short stories I wrote in hopes he would see that I was just like him. Our moms hit it off instantly and decided that Dave and I should be raised together so we would feel more like we had a family, so they bought a duplex in Illinois, halfway between their hometowns, and raised us together. What we were lacking in a father, we more than made up for in mothers.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I bet you're wondering what the hell any of this has to do with anything and why the hell you should care. As we already established, I'm insignificant. I'm the child of a minor celebrity who no one even remembers as the author of a few novels that can quite often be found stuffed behind the Harlequin romances in used bookstores. I haven't given you a reason to care about this backstory. You don't even know my name or why you should waste your time turning the next page. But, let me ask you something. Isn't that the way you go into every novel? Not really knowing why you should care? And yes, I probably should have found a clever way to work this backstory into the main action - show, don't tell and all of that good advice, but I feel like you need to know where I've been to really care about where I am. Your time is precious so wouldn't you rather I just spend a few paragraphs getting you caught up? Don't you sometimes secretly wish an author would just get on with it and tell you what you need to know? I promise, neither one of us will believe where this ends up.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Dave and I were inseparable once we became aware that the other existed. Dave was my playmate, my co-conspirator, my confidante, and eventually my protector. I was quiet, naive, and still seeking my father's love and Dave was constantly pulling me back from situations where I was ready to give myself too soon to feel special. In high school he relished the role of misfit while I dreamt of being popular like the girls in my teen romances. That is, until Dave discovered punk rock and dragged me along with him into the mosh pit. Literally and figuratively. Here were misfits who fit. Here were girls who would rather die than be one of the popular kids. Here was a bass line and a three chord progression that slid into my cochlea and threw itself around the inside of my ear. Here was something that made me feel alive. And made me want to tell my dad to fuck off, since telling your parents to fuck off was now cool. Our poor mothers.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Where I was content to listen and let the anger wash over me, Dave wanted to create the rage. He wanted to be the one slamming his way into the safety pinned ears of the punks. And he wanted me to join him. He bought a drum set, he befriended a couple of punks at school who could play the requisite three chords, and we were a band. Although I wasn't quite sure what my role in the whole thing was. I had written a few songs because they weren't that different from the angsty poetry all teenagers write between the ages of 13 and 17. I liked the way the music wrapped around my words and animated them. Made them stand up in 3D and declare their existence. Dave decided I should sing because, really, it was better to not be able to sing in a punk band anyway. We called ourselves Yeah Nadia, because why not?</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">That's how I ended up losing my virginity in a back room at The Fireside Bowl with a guy who also couldn't sing and fronted a band called Automat Sandwich. The band sucked, but he was a really nice guy who asked multiple times during our what-the-hell-am-I-doing sex if I was ok. I always thought that was sweet and while the relationship went nowhere, we stayed friends when he started another band and actually had some minor fame.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">If I ever start another band, which I won't, I might call it "Minor Fame Adjacent," since that's how my life has gone. Brushes with minor celebrities while living in obscurity. Dave gave up on the band and went to college for business. I actually held on to the lead singer role until grunge came along and killed punk, and I graduated from high school and decided I needed a real job. That's how they get you to give up, how they convince you to hang up your torn fishnets and do something respectable. They ask you how you'll pay your bills and what kind of life you think you'll have sweating your makeup off every night for an audience of twenty. So I followed Dave to college and majored in writing. Because, yeah, that was a more reliable path (I obviously had learned nothing from my absentee father.)</p></div><div class="footer"><div class="data-bar"></div></div></div></div></div><div id="right-content" class="leaf" style="--sidebar-width: var(--sidebar-width-right);"><div id="right-sidebar" class="sidebar"><div class="sidebar-handle"></div><div class="sidebar-topbar"><div class="topbar-content"><label class="theme-toggle-container" for="theme-toggle-input" id=""><input class="theme-toggle-input" type="checkbox" id="theme-toggle-input"><div class="toggle-background"></div></label></div><div class="clickable-icon sidebar-collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="3" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon"><path d="M21 3H3C1.89543 3 1 3.89543 1 5V19C1 20.1046 1.89543 21 3 21H21C22.1046 21 23 20.1046 23 19V5C23 3.89543 22.1046 3 21 3Z"></path><path d="M10 4V20"></path><path d="M4 7H7"></path><path d="M4 10H7"></path><path d="M4 13H7"></path></svg></div></div><div class="sidebar-content-wrapper"><div id="right-sidebar-content" class="leaf-content"><div class="graph-view-wrapper"><div class="feature-header"><div class="feature-title">Interactive Graph</div></div><div class="graph-view-placeholder">
