I can feel that you think there are many important things I have left untold. And you're right. You have questions, I get that, so let's pause for another moment for a little Q&amp;A. Just shout out your questions and I'll try to answer as best I can.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Q. You mention how close you were to Dave and then he just falls out of the story. What's up with that?<br>
A. I think it can just be something that happens as siblings get older. We went to different colleges, we chose different paths. He was never happy with my choice to reconnect with our dad, even though I had no regrets about that. My dad had stayed clean and found fulfillment as a grandpa. I tried and tried to get Dave to just try with him, but there was too much hurt in him to look at what could be on the other side of it. Dave and I stayed in contact, we kept up with each other's lives, we visited and made an excellent uncle and aunt to the other's kids. I just stopped looking to him to steer me. And he never figured out how to allow me that space. There wasn't a falling out, just a drifting that felt like the glacial creep of the continents leaving Pangea, until we were further apart than we realized.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Q. What about your mom? Where are the other women in this story?<br>
A. That is an excellent point. You're absolutely right. It has been a bit male dominated, hasn't it? I suppose that's a bit of a squeaky wheel gets the grease phenomena. My mothers (I always felt lucky that Dave's mom was as loving to me as my own mother, and Dave felt the same about mine. We call them our moms.) were nothing but supportive, strong, independent women who taught us that, in a male dominated world, it was the women keeping things together behind the scenes. I never grew out of touch with them. I talked to them weekly at least the whole time I was in the Seattle area. I asked them for advice, I cried on their distant shoulders, and I relied on them heavily when things were ending. They do deserve a starring role in my story. I'll take that into consideration.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Q. I feel like I know more about a guy you slept with a handful of times in your teens than about the man you were married to for 22 years.<br>
A. That's not a question, but that's true. My husband was an extra even in our own lives. He was a walk on role that had a line or two and left the scene. I wish that wasn't the case, but I have to stick to the script. He was an actor and I never really knew which him was the real him. He was dedicated and charming and ran his hands over my midsection like he worshipped Rubenesque paintings. I think that was the real him. The first months of our daughter's life, I think that was the real him. Happy and content with a baby sleeping on his chest while he studied a script for another bit part. But, then he got the actual role. The actual come to the studio everyday and be a bit player in this sitcom. And people recognized him occasionally. And then that was him. He was a star. A minor celebrity who didn't want a wife and two kids. he wanted to be free to run his hands over the tiny waists of his co-stars. He wasn't evil. He wasn't abusive. He just wasn't. Wasn't there. I had experience at playing the quiet ghost girl, so I took the lines from my mother's award winning roles and applied them to my mothering, but I never made myself whole enough to ask for more. It was relief when he told me that it was over. I had been waiting.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Q. What about your kids? Don't you feel like you should have stayed for them?<br>
A. No. I don't and I'm kind of shocked you would say such a thing in these modern times. My kids were 23 and 21 when everything imploded and they weren't stupid. They had lived with their father missing for years. They have lives of their own and wouldn't want their mother to continue in something that made her feel like an extra in her own life. I love them dearly, but honestly, this isn't their story, nor my story to tell on their behalf.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Q. Your dad was so integral in the backstory. Why is that when he seems a minor player in the real thing?<br>
A. I know that Facebook has made it seem like we need to stay in contact with every person who has ever come into our lives and that they should have an equal role throughout, but that isn't how real life is. Just like my brother and I were closer when we were kids and lived together, just like Jay was the first man who showed me how gentle love could be, but faded into the past, just like my ex-husband now has a life separate from mine (we have stayed friends for the kids and our own peace), my dad was so important when I was younger simply because he wasn't there. He was a figure I had to make up in my mind. I romanticized him until his absent presence formed me into who I became. Once we reconnected and he stacked up one sober year after another, he was just a man. A man who I was grateful to have in my life, but he became just my dad and my kid's grandpa. He was integral to the backstory, just like Dave. Then he was just a part of the comforting background noise of my days instead of the out of reach guitar solo he had been when I was a kid.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Q. You say you were this quiet bookworm of a girl, but you sang in a punk band, wore fishnets, and got fucked in backrooms of nightclubs. I don't buy it. Were you a wallflower or the whole fucking rose bush?<br>
A. You're question is framed in the mythical binary of either/or. I had to be this or that. One or the other. This is the fallacy of all or nothing thinking (yeah, I've been to therapy). I was and am both. There was something about that punk scene. Something about being in that band, that brought out a deep soul wounded howl. I let out every bit of the pain I hid from everyone on that stage. And I numbed the rest by fucking men who couldn't have cared less about me in dark places where they couldn't see me cry. I was the quiet bookworm, the saintly mother, and the howling punk rocker on my knees with a dick in my mouth. I am multi-dimensional. (Look up the lyrics to Meredith Brooks's song "Bitch." Then we'll talk some more.)</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">One more question then we really need to get back to the story - </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Q. You're not very good at this are you.<br>
A. Motherfucker, I told you I was once writing a novel that starred an alien trying to be a popular girl. What do you think?</p></div><div class="footer"><div class="data-bar"></div></div></div></div></div><div id="right-content" class="leaf" style="--sidebar-width: var(--sidebar-width-right);"><div id="right-sidebar" class="sidebar"><div class="sidebar-handle"></div><div class="sidebar-topbar"><div class="topbar-content"><label class="theme-toggle-container" for="theme-toggle-input" id=""><input class="theme-toggle-input" type="checkbox" id="theme-toggle-input"><div class="toggle-background"></div></label></div><div class="clickable-icon sidebar-collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="3" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon"><path d="M21 3H3C1.89543 3 1 3.89543 1 5V19C1 20.1046 1.89543 21 3 21H21C22.1046 21 23 20.1046 23 19V5C23 3.89543 22.1046 3 21 3Z"></path><path d="M10 4V20"></path><path d="M4 7H7"></path><path d="M4 10H7"></path><path d="M4 13H7"></path></svg></div></div><div class="sidebar-content-wrapper"><div id="right-sidebar-content" class="leaf-content"><div class="graph-view-wrapper"><div class="feature-header"><div class="feature-title">Interactive Graph</div></div><div class="graph-view-placeholder">
