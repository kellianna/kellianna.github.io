I did it for several months and then decided that my joy of reading was being diminished by this, so I gave that up. I still ended up reading quite a few books this year and thought I’d do a top 10 list to round up my 2017 reading, in no particular order:</p></div><div class="el-ul"><ul class="has-list-bullet">
<li data-line="0" dir="auto"><span class="list-bullet"></span>Dark Matter | Blake Crouch - An excellent novel about alternate realities.</li>

<li data-line="2" dir="auto"><span class="list-bullet"></span>The Girl From the Well | Rin Chupeco - Based on a Japanese folktale, a very poetic “horror” novel (I didn’t find it that frightening) about a ghost who seeks revenge on people who murder children.</li>
<li data-line="3" dir="auto"><span class="list-bullet"></span>Real Happiness | Sharon Salzberg - How to use meditation and mindfulness to live a happier life. Sharon Salzberg is one of my favorite Buddhist teachers.</li>
<li data-line="4" dir="auto"><span class="list-bullet"></span>The Humans | Matt Haig - An alien sent from an idyllic world to murder a professor who has just solved a mathematical problem that was supposed to remain unsolved. He takes the professor’s place and slowly begins to embrace what makes us human.</li>

</ul></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I’ve already got a stack of books ready to go for 2018. I hope to be better about sticking with a book next year, I abandon way too many books lately.</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-h2"><h2 data-heading="January Books" dir="auto" class="heading" id="January_Books_0"><span class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></span>January Books</h2></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">One of my New Year's Resolutions was to read a book a week in 2017. It's the only resolution I've kept so far. 😊 This month I read:</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Writing Down the Bones•Natalie Goldberg - An excellent book to help break out of a writing rut and play with creativity. Written in short vignettes, it's not a "how-to" manual, but contains exercises and ideas to help put emotion into your writing, ways to challenge your writing.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>The Midnight Assassin</strong>•Skip Hollandsworth - The true story of a serial killer in Austin, Texas in 1885. The detail in this book makes you feel like you're in Austin in the 1800s. It not only details the early days of the city and the murders, but also shows how the investigation was hindered by the lack of technology and the racist beliefs of the time.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>And Then There Were None</strong>•Agatha Christie - I've read several books by Agatha Christie and enjoyed them all. This "cozy" mystery takes place on an island where the murderer has to be one of the characters investigating the murders. This one had me reading every moment I could spare just so I could find out who the murderer was.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Hunger Makes Me a Modern Girl</strong>•Carrie Brownstein - The autobiography of the Sleater-Kinney guitarist and one of the creators of the show "Portlandia." I (falsely) believed that Sleater-Kinney was a Seattle band and hoped this book would talk a little about the music scene in Seattle in the 90s. They are actually from Olympia, Washington and other than touring with Pearl Jam, had very little to do with the Seattle scene. Still, I like Brownstein and this was a very interesting read about being in an all female punk band in the 90s. She seems very down to earth, a little lost and with a touch of anxiety. Several relatable passages here.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Bonus book:</strong> The Outsiders•SE Hinton - I wanted my daughter to read this and she wasn't sure she would like it, so we read it together. Even teenagers benefit from reading aloud. I'm really glad we did, because this was one of my favorite books as a teen, but had forgotten quite a bit of the story. It was nice to share it with her.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I started Captains and the Kings by Taylor Caldwell last night. It's 650 pages, so I may need to give myself 2 weeks!</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">February Books</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">One of my New Year's Resolutions is to read a book a week in 2017. I had planned to spend a couple of weeks reading “Captains and the Kings” which was recommended to me by my grandma. The story is very good, but it is so wordy! Taylor Caldwell spends entire paragraphs describing a mountain or a house. I’ve only made it a quarter of the way through because I get a little bored with it. I’m still working on it though. I had a few books come in that I’d had on hold at the library, so I did still end up reading a book per week. This month I read:</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Dark Matter</strong>•Blake Crouch - I devoured this book in a weekend. I was hooked from the very beginning. The plot involves a physics professor who gets kidnapped and discovers the existence of the multiverse. This book had me thinking for days about the choices we make and how cool it would be if new universes split off from every decision we made. Just a very cool novel!</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</strong>•JK Rowling, John Tiffany, Jack Thorne - I wasn’t sure I wanted to read this. First of all it’s a play and secondly, it wasn’t written entirely by JK Rowling, but it’s canon to the story, so I had to. I really enjoyed the story, it was nice to be back in the wizarding world (I read the books to my kids over a period of 2 years. I was sad when we ended the 7th book because it felt like we had been living at Hogwarts for so long!), and the feel was true to the books. I did have a problem with a few of the details (the workings of the polyjuice potion, Hermione didn’t protect that time tuner very well) and I really hated the way Ron was portrayed (he’s my favorite!), but all in all I enjoyed it and it was good to see that even Harry Potter has issues parenting! </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>What Alice Forgot</strong>•Liane Moriarty - Another that I read in just a few days. I loved this book! The main character falls off of her bike at spin class and loses her memory of the last 10 years. She doesn’t even remember her children. I think part of the reason I liked the book so much was that I could really relate to Alice. I highlighted a ton of passages in the book. It also made me think about memories and the things that make our lives what they are. The nature of relationships and the way that shared experiences shape them.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>How Not to Die</strong>•Dr. Michael Gregor - Just your basic book about eating a plant based diet for living a healthier life. I’m already 99% vegan, so I didn’t need convincing about the benefits of plants. However, this book is filled with the science behind why some foods are better for us than others and it inspired me to clean up my eating. I had become a bit of a “junk food vegan.”</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">I have been reading “Charlotte’s Web” with my son and “The Absolutely True story of a Part Time Indian” with my daughter. I’m hoping to finish both of those in the next week or so. I also have to get back to “Captains and the Kings.”</p></div><div class="el-hr"><hr></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">April Books</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">One of my New Year’s Resolutions was to read a book a week in 2017. In April I read:</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>The Girl from the Well*</strong>Rin Chupeco - I really, really loved this “horror” novel. I’m not much into the horror genre (although I do enjoy a good zombie book), but this didn’t contain too much gore and it was really beautifully written. The story is based on an actual Japanese folk tale about Okiku, a spirit who haunts a well in Japan. In the book she leaves the well and avenges the deaths of children who have been murdered. Freeing their souls. She meets a teenage boy who is haunted by a dark spirit and they end up travelling to Japan as she tries to help him. The writing in this book is almost poetic and the imagery is wonderful. An excellent story that I enjoyed very much.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>The Little Book of Hygge*</strong>Meik Wiking - I don’t know why I wasted my time with this. I like the Danish idea of Hygge - basically creating a cozy atmosphere. This book really could have been summed up in a blog post. It’s repetitive and makes the whole thing seem very pretentious. Apparently you need hundred dollar lamps, organic vegetables and sheep skins to create hygge. It talked about leaving restaurants because they aren’t hygge enough. I don’t know, the whole thing just felt like taking a really simple thing and complicating it for the sake of writing a book. </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane*</strong>Kate DiCamillo - Technically, I read this book to my son over the course of the month, but it is such a beautifully written book that I wanted to include it here. The story really isn’t just for kids. A china rabbit named Edward Tulane finds himself on many adventures filled with heartbreak while he learns what it means to love and to be loved. This book made me cry. Really wonderful writing and such a lovely story.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto"><strong>Why I Wake Early*</strong>Mary Oliver - I’m trying to read more poetry books and I have always wanted to read Mary Oliver. This is a very slim book that could probably be read in a day. I read it a few times, highlighting  lines throughout. I can relate to Oliver’s love of nature and I like the simplicity of her words. There is deep meaning in that simplicity! I look forward to reading more poetry by Mary Oliver.<br>
…<br>
This was another weird month of not reading as much as I would have liked. I’ve been having a hard time sticking to a book. I started and didn’t finish a couple of books this month. I really feel it’s still trying to get through The Captains and Kings that is keeping me from reading other things. I would have given up on this book long ago if I wasn’t reading it at my grandmother’s request. I’ve decided to read the chapters she specifically wanted me to read and then go back and try to finish the book a little at a time. I fall asleep every time I start reading it! </p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">June Books</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Last month I complained that my New Year’s Resolution to read a book a week had put so much pressure on me, that I had gotten to the point where I wasn’t reading anything. So, I gave up the resolution and ended up reading more that usual in the month of June. So, even though I said I wasn’t going to do this, here’s a roundup of the books I read:</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Ready Player One|Ernest Cline - I had a whole stack of new books to read, but instead I started off the month by going back to a book I love. I have now read this book three times and I enjoy it just as much everytime. The book takes place in a dystopian future where everyone spends most of their days logged into the virtual world of the OASIS. I fear an actual VR like the OASIS will be developed because it really does sound awesome. The creator of the OASIS dies and leaves behind a kind of Easter Egg hunt to win his entire fortune. Since he had come of age in the 80s, people looking for the clues have to become experts in pop culture of the 80s. With all of its video game references and 80s pop culture references, this book is perfect for a geeky 80s kid like me. It’s just a really fun read.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Dream Work|Mary Oliver - Another amazing collection by Mary Oliver. I just love her quiet insightfulness and deep appreciation for the lessons hidden in nature. I really love the poem “Wild Geese” which is included here. Also, “The Journey,” “Sunrise,” and “The Waves.” The whole book is wonderful, but those are my favorites. There’s much food for thought here. (Thank you for the recommendation, Marie!)</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Jesus’ Son|Denis Johnson - I first came across this book when @whiskeyandpens posted about it. Then when Johnson died last month, I read a few articles he had written for Salon. The one about homeschooling his son really hit home and echoed so many of my own views about the school system and why I homeschool. So, I decided I had to give this book of short stories a try. I have to say that I was really undecided about it until the end. It wasn’t really my thing, and the little vignettes about alcoholics and drugs seemed like they didn’t have much of a point. Yet, there were moments of sheer poetry sprinkled throughout the book and the last story really brought it all together for me. I may not ever read it again, but it was enjoyable.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The Humans|Matt Haig - I somehow ended up following Matt Haig on Twitter even though I had never read any of his novels. He tweets a lot about suffering from depression and anxiety in a way I can really relate to. This book popped up on sale on Amazon for a couple of dollars, so I bought it. I really, really enjoyed it. Yes, it contains a lot of cliche observations about humans, but it was still beautifully written. The basic premise is that a mathematician on Earth studying prime numbers comes up with a formula that would change all of human existence. An alien race, itself living in a society based on geometry and prime numbers, decides humankind is not ready for this bombshell discovery and sends an alien to Earth to stop it. His job is to kill the mathematician, take his place as his clone to find out who else he told about the discovery and kill them. Instead he ends up finding a deep love and understanding for the humans and ultimately decides to stay on Earth. I just really loved the observations about the good things about humanity in this book. We face our own ugliness as a species everyday and it was nice to be reminded that there are good things about us.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Queen of Hearts|Dipendra Tamang - Our own @thangbalay published a book of his poems and I had to buy it! The poems are all dedicated to “women and the strength of their being…” I really feel that this is some of Dipendra’s best work here. I especially enjoyed “Flawed,” “Her Three State,” “Be Like,” “LIghtning,” and “Water the Plants.” Thank you, Dip for a book of poetry that celebrates women.&nbsp;</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">The Book of Whimsies|CS Hughes - Another poetry book by a member of the IG community, @cshughes. I am going to be honest here - I started this book once and then abandoned it. But, after reading his work on IG, I decided to try it again. I’m glad I did! This is just a really beautiful book of poetry. I don’t always understand what Hughes is talking about, but I love the sound of the way his words flow. The way they feel in my brain. I especially loved the “Billy Ruffian” poems, “Dragonfly Days,” “Dapple,” “Sirtaki,”&nbsp; and “A Poem For You and The End Of Time.” I hope to read his other books available on Amazon.</p></div><div class="el-p"><p dir="auto">Real Happiness|Sharon Salzberg - It’s no secret to anyone who’s followed me for awhile that I suffer from anxiety. A lot of it is social anxiety. Did I say the wrong thing? Did I do something stupid? Did I make a mistake and not realize? Am I bothering people with my presence? It’s also everyday stuff. Did I turn off the coffee pot? Is the door locked? Did I pay that bill? Driving just about makes me want to jump out of my skin. Not wanting to go on medication, I try to get some exercise, sunshine, and vitamin B everyday. That all helps somewhat. But what really helps? 20 minutes of meditation every day. I can’t explain it, but it really, really helps. It helps me examine the ways I let myself get carried away in my head and allows me to stop the spiraling thoughts. This book is 28 days of meditation and mindfulness practice to build concentration, awareness of our bodies and thoughts and lovingkindness. The lovingkindness meditations really help because I tend to be really hard on myself. I love, love Sharon Salzberg. She is really down to earth and relatable. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to start a meditation practice and maybe find a little extra calm in your life.</p></div><div class="footer"><div class="data-bar"></div></div></div></div></div><div id="right-content" class="leaf" style="--sidebar-width: var(--sidebar-width-right);"><div id="right-sidebar" class="sidebar"><div class="sidebar-handle"></div><div class="sidebar-topbar"><div class="topbar-content"><label class="theme-toggle-container" for="theme-toggle-input" id=""><input class="theme-toggle-input" type="checkbox" id="theme-toggle-input"><div class="toggle-background"></div></label></div><div class="clickable-icon sidebar-collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="3" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon"><path d="M21 3H3C1.89543 3 1 3.89543 1 5V19C1 20.1046 1.89543 21 3 21H21C22.1046 21 23 20.1046 23 19V5C23 3.89543 22.1046 3 21 3Z"></path><path d="M10 4V20"></path><path d="M4 7H7"></path><path d="M4 10H7"></path><path d="M4 13H7"></path></svg></div></div><div class="sidebar-content-wrapper"><div id="right-sidebar-content" class="leaf-content"><div class="graph-view-wrapper"><div class="feature-header"><div class="feature-title">Interactive Graph</div></div><div class="graph-view-placeholder">
